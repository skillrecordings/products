# turbo-playground

This is an exploratory project using Turborepo and pnpm to create a monorepo working environment for multiple applications and a shared common core library (or set of libraries.

## Get Started

You'll need [pnpm](https://twitter.com/pnpmjs) installed.

pnpm is used here based on [significant performance gains](https://twitter.com/jaredpalmer/status/1422574985323950083?s=20) reported by Jared Palmer from a customer.

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm turbo run build
```

This will build (and cache) the library packages and applications.

You can start the template next.js app:

```bash
cd apps/next-product-starter && pnpm run dev
```

## Tools Used

### Turborepo

> abstracting the complex configuration needed for most monorepos into a single cohesive build system

Turbo is the core of the developer experience that this playground is exploring and provides cohesive logical building of a monorepo that contains many apps and library packages.

It's a closed source paid product that we are excited to use and support.

### Changset

> ðŸ¦‹ A way to manage your versioning and changelogs with a focus on monorepos

Changeset is an Atlassian library that makes releasing library versions a little nicer.

### pnpm

> Fast, disk space efficient package manager

performant npm is just what it says it is and a modern evolution of npm/yarn etc that follows the same conventions and gives efficiency in a monorepo environment and can shave a lot of time off of builds.

### cypress

for integration and e2e testing
