If we don't specify the target details in `Cargo.toml` _and_ we don't have the default `src/main.rs` file, then we see this error message from the compiler when we build.\r\n\r\n```\r\n❯ cargo build\r\nerror: failed to parse manifest at `/Users/chris/weather-cli/Cargo.toml`\r\n\r\nCaused by:\r\n  no targets specified in the manifest\r\n  either src/lib.rs, src/main.rs, a [lib] section, or [[bin]] section must be present\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis message is telling us that we need at least one library or binary target to be able to build the project. If we don't want to use `src/main.rs`, we can specify the binary by adding a [`[[bin]]` field](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/cargo-targets.html#binaries) in our `Cargo.toml`\r\n\r\n```\r\n[[bin]]\r\nname = \"weather-cli\"\r\npath = \"src/my-binary-file.rs\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is also how you'd specify a number of other configuration options for how to build a specific target, such as the name of the binary that gets built.\r\n\r\n#### No `main` function\r\n\r\nIf we rename the main function in `main.rs` to something nonsensical like `fn asfasf()` then when we try to build we'll see this error message.\r\n\r\n```\r\n❯ cargo build\r\n   Compiling thingd v0.1.0 (/Users/chris/weather-cli)\r\nerror[E0601]: `main` function not found in crate `weather-cli`\r\n --> src/main.rs:1:1\r\n  |\r\n1 | / fn asfasf() {\r\n2 | |     println!(\"Hello, world!\");\r\n3 | | }\r\n  | |_^ consider adding a `main` function to `src/main.rs`\r\n\r\nerror: aborting due to previous error\r\n\r\nFor more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0601`.\r\nerror: could not compile `thingd`\r\n\r\nTo learn more, run the command again with --verbose.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe most important piece of the error message is this line:\r\n\r\n> consider adding a `main` function to `src/main.rs\r\n\r\nThis error occurs because we _must_ have a function called `main` in the binary entrypoint file. It is a convention enforced by the compiler.\r\n\r\nIn the future when we get into async Rust and other higher level macros, this error can pop up if you've misconfigured a macro that wraps the main function.","tagId":2479279},"envVariables":{"question":"Semicolons are important in other languages for seemingly arbitrary reasons.\n\n What happens if you remove the semicolon from the `dbg!` call in our program?

The default return value of a function is `()`\r\n2. Everything in Rust is either a Statement or an Expression\r\n3. `dbg!` returns the value of the expression we pass it\r\n4. Semicolons turn Expressions into Statements\r\n\r\n## 1. The default return value of a function is `()`\r\n\r\n`()` is pronounced \"unit\" and is a 0 element tuple. If we don't specify a return type for our functions, they return `()` by default. The type unit `()` and the only value that can satisfy that type `()` are spelled the same way. This means if a function's return type is `()`, then the only value we can return at the end of our function is `()`.\r\n\r\nBy comparison in JavaScript if a function returns the type \"Number\", then it would return values like: `1`, `2`, `3`, etc.\r\n\r\n## 2. Everything in Rust is either a Statement or an Expression\r\n\r\nRust is primarily an Expression based language. This means that inside of a block there is always a return value from that block. This even applies to `if`.\r\n\r\nIn JavaScript `if` is a statement, and thus doesn't return a value. This leads us into using hacks like ternary operators, or `mything && MyComponent`.\r\n\r\nIn Rust, we can return values from an if expression and put them into a variable as such.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet y = if 12 * 15 > 150 {\r\n    \"Bigger\"\r\n} else {\r\n    \"Smaller\"\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could put this into a function that returns a `String`. Notice how we removed the variable assignment as well as the semi-colon. The last value in an expression will be returned.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn test_a_number() -> String {\r\n    if 12 * 15 > 150 {\r\n        \"Bigger\".to_string()\r\n    } else {\r\n        \"Smaller\".to_string()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, that means `\"Bigger\".to_string()` is returned from one branch of the if expression, and `\"Smaller\".to_string()` is returned from the other branch of the if expression.\r\n\r\nThis means that overall the if expression returns a `String`, and since the if expression is the last expression in the function body, the function returns a `String` as well.\r\n\r\n## 3. `dbg!` returns the value of the expression we pass it\r\n\r\nOne unique feature of the `dbg!` macro is that since it is use for debugging purposes, the value returned from it is the value of the expression we pass it. It's as if the `dbg!` macro wasn't even there.\r\n\r\nIn the following example, we print out the result of `dbg!(2) == 2`, which is the same as `2 == 2`, to prove that `dbg` passes the value through.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() {\r\n    println!(\"{}\", dbg!(2) == 2);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 4. Semicolons turn Expressions into Statements\r\n\r\nSo to recap:\r\n\r\n- Functions return the `()` type by default\r\n- Most things in Rust are expressions\r\n- The last value in an expression is returned from that expression\r\n- `dbg!` returns whatever we give it, as is.\r\n\r\nThat means we're left with a main function with `dbg!` in the last position, which returns whatever we gave it. In this case, that was the api token: a `String`.\r\n\r\nThis lets us read the error message we got from the Rust compiler. First, the compiler expected `()` because that's a function's default return type.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n  |\r\n1 | fn main() {\r\n  |           - expected `()` because of default return type\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, on line 4, the compiler expected the `()` value because the default return type of the function told it to. Instead, it found that we are returning a `String` because `dbg!` returns whatever we give it, and `dbg!` is in the last position in the function body, which means whatever value it is, is what gets returned from the function.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n4 |     dbg!(api_token)\r\n  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected `()`, found struct `String`\r\n  |\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the question becomes how do we discard the `dbg!` value and the answer is the semicolon: `;`.\r\n\r\nA semicolon is an operator that takes an expression, evaluates it, then discards the result. In place of the discarded result, we get `()`, which is the return type we need for the `main` function.\r\n\r\nThis is why the semicolon is important. It takes our `dbg!` expression and evaluates it which lets us print to the console, while also letting us return `()`.","tagId":2479287},"cliArgs":{"question":"We've used `std::env::args` in the example from the email, but for more complex applications we'd likely use a crate.
