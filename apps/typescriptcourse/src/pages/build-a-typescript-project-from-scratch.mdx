Proficiency in a language also includes knowing how to share code.

You canâ€™t get away with not knowing how to do this.

It is **essential** to climbing the engineering ladder.

Whether youâ€™re publishing a private library for your team or an open source library on behalf of your company, knowing how to do so is an essential skill in TypeScript proficiency, and in any language for that matter.

Think about the code you use in your team today.

- Are there any utility functions, frameworks, or tools that might be worth sharing?
- Are there modules you find yourself copying between projects?

These are worthy candidates for published code!

But starting new TypeScript projects from scratch and taking it to deployment and distribution is a vast process filled with uncertainty.

- How do I set up a TypeScript project with industry best practices in mind?
- How do I distribute my code on npm and consume it in a production application?
- How do I start writing robust, well-tested systems with TypeScritp from the start?

These are questions that youâ€™re probably asking yourself.

And if youâ€™re not, I would be concern ðŸ˜³

Itâ€™s one thing to migrate an existing project to TypeScript. Itâ€™s another thing to build cutting-edge TypeScript projects from zero.

And the vast majority of courses fail short and donâ€™t go the full mile. They donâ€™t teach you how to build a TypeScript project from scratch without templates or special bundlers, how to test your TypeScript code, publish your code, and how to consume it in an application.

In this module, the good news is that you will learn how to build a streak counter from scratch.

<CheckList className="bg-gradient-to-b from-white/5 to-white/0 bg-opacity-5 supports-backdrop-blur:backdrop-blur-sm lg:px-12 md:px-8 px-5 pb-5 md:pt-3 pt-2 lg:-mx-12 md:-mx-8 -mx-5 backdrop-brightness-150 sm:rounded-lg shadow-xl">

Along the way, you will gain practical experience working with fundamental TypeScript concepts, like:

- Interfaces
- parameter type annotations
- return type annotations
- type guard
- union types
- type predicates
- and more!

</CheckList>

Once you are done developing, publishing, and consuming your Streak counter, you will have the confidence to lead initiatives across your team, whether thatâ€™s publishing utility functions, frameworks, or tools that might be worth sharing.

Are you ready?

Weâ€™re going streaking!
