This three-part guide will walk you through the process of migrating real JavaScript code into a tested TypeScript codebase.

You will leverage open-source and unit testing as a tool for learning TypeScript.

Youâ€™ll learn how to:

- migrate a JavaScript project to TypeScript
- leverage TypeScript types in JSDoc blocks
- write unit test with Jest & TypeScript
- As engineers, we interact with open source every day. The difference is the level of interaction. This guide will dive into the code head-first and leverage open source as learning tool.

So, buckle up! ðŸ¤ 

Weâ€™re going into the wild west of open-source JavaScript to unearth a project that started 6 years ago.
