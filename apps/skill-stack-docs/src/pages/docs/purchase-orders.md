title: Quotes, Purchase Orders, and Invoices
description: Selling products to enterprise customers.
---

Large enterprise customers often have a procurement process that
requires you to provide them with a quote, purchase order, and
invoice. This is a brief overview of the process.

Typically, there are 3 documents that are used to sell products to enterprise customers:

- Quotes
- Purchase Orders
- Invoices

## Quotes

Quotes originate from the seller and provide enterprise customers
with a basis to create a purchase order.

The quote is generally approved or changes are requested by the
customer. Once they have approved the quote, they will create a
purchase order based on the quote.

A quote is not a legal document and is not used to collect payment
from the customer.

Quotes can be created in Stripe and you can download a PDF of the
quote to send to the customer.

### Registration as a Vendor

In order to sell products to enterprise customers, you will need
to register as a vendor with the customer. This is generally done
by filling out a form and providing information about your company
such as:

- Company Name
- Address
- Tax ID
- DUNS Number
- W9

Not all enterprise customers will require you to register as a
vendor. Some will just require a quote and a purchase order.

## Purchase Orders

**Purchase orders are created by the customer** and are based on the
quote. The purchase order is a legal document that is used to
create an invoice.

Generally they will provide a PO number that is used to track the
purchase order. It is important to include the PO number on the
invoice.

## Invoices

Invoices are created by the seller and are based on the purchase
order. The invoice is a legal document that is used to collect
payment from the customer.

## NET Terms

NET terms are the number of days that the customer has to pay the
invoice. For example, NET 30 means that the customer has 30 days
to pay the invoice.

## Payment Methods

Payment methods are the ways that the customer can pay the invoice.

- Credit Card
- ACH

We strongly prefer to use Stripe for credit card payments and
ACH payments via their invoicing system.
