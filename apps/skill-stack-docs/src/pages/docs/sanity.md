description: How Skill Stack uses Sanity.
---

Sanity is a headless CMS that allows you to create content with a React-based editor. It comes with a real-time collaborative editor, rich-text editing, and asset management.

## Configuring Sanity

`create-skill-stack` uses a default Sanity project id and dataset that needs
to be changed to the appropriate Sanity project id for your project.

`NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` in `.env.development` and `.env.production`

### Create a new Sanity Project

Create a temp folder someplace on your hard drive. Using the Sanity CLI you can create a new Sanity project in the temp folder. Make sure it is a "clean" dataset and not one with example data.

```bash
npm create sanity@latest 
cat sanity.config.ts 
```

Copy the project id and replace it `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` in `.env.development` and `.env.production`.
