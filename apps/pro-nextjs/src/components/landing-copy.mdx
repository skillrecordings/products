You know how to build React apps. Your Next.js app is humming along. You are productive and confident.

**You’re comfortable.**

Or are you?

Just when you thought you had it all figured out with React apps and Next.js, **the React landscape has shifted completely**.

{<p className="text-center sm:py-10 py-6 text-2xl font-normal max-w-lg mx-auto text-gray-800"><Balancer>React Server Components and the App router are here, and they're not going anywhere.</Balancer></p>}

This isn't just a minor update - it's a seismic shift that's shaking the foundations of your Next.js apps. The component lifecycle, data loading, data movement from server to client, even the basics of structuring your component tree - everything is in flux.

But what if you could turn this upheaval into an opportunity? What if you could not only adapt to these changes but also leverage them to create more powerful, efficient, and robust applications?

Pro NextJS is your guide through this new terrain.
