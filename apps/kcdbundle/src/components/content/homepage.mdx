# The Proven Path to Building Professional-grade React Apps

## Now available at an unbeatable price

## Stuck in Analysis Paralysis

Building enterprise-grade applications means making decisions.

From prioritizing features to handling deployment, there are things to think about at every step of the project lifecycle.

Each step of the way, you have to keep your balance:

*How will this affect the user? How will maintaining it affect my team?*

## Choose Wisely

React is *the* choice for building high quality, scalable web applications.

But knowing *what* to choose isn't enough--you need the *why* and *how*.

Understanding the mental models of React allows you to build the foundation for utilizing its most powerful features.

## "It Works" isn't Good Enough

Having a working application is just the start. It may be working today, but are you sure it'll work after every change in the future?

In order to be a true professional, you also need to be testing.

Of course, this means more decisions to make:

*What should I test? Do I have to have 100% coverage?*

*How am I supposed to add testing to my workflow?*

## The Clock is Ticking

Building a deep understanding of React apps and how to test them isn't the hard partâ€“ I've taught tens of thousands of developers how to write fully tested, enterprise-grade apps.

The hard part is making the time.

Time is the most valuable thing you have.

The hours you spend learning will help you further your career, but it comes at the cost of being away from your family and friends.

You could choose to spend your time searching the web for videos and articles that might end up being helpful-- but how do you know if what you read reflects industry best practices?

You need to be sure that the time you invest is spent correctly.

## You need the KCD Bundle.

Now available, the KCD Bundle brings **Testing JavaScript** and **Epic React** together for a special discounted price.

The material I teach in these self-paced trainings has evolved thanks to the feedback from hundreds of live workshop attendees.

Developers just like you, who have made the decision to invest in themselves and their careers.

Now it's your turn.
