You’ve been using Tailwind CSS for a while, and you don't need convincing: you are already “sold” on the paradigm shift of using presentational classnames in your HTML.

You’re already productive with Tailwind,{' '} **but you want to take your skills to the next level.**

As you paddle deeper into the Tailwind ocean, you can't help but wonder:

<div className="prose-li:marker:content-['?'] prose-li:marker:text-brand-red prose-li:marker:font-bold prose-li:marker:font-heading sm:prose-ul:pl-2 sm:prose-li:pl-5 prose-ul:pl-2 prose-li:pl-5">

- How do I organise styles for reusable UI components with multiple style variants?
- What’s the best way to support advanced theming in Tailwind, beyond dark mode?
- How can I share my Tailwind components across multiple, independent projects seamlessly?
