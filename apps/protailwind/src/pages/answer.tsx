      answer:
        'While they may appear possibly legitimate, `aria-alert` and `role="tableheader"` are not valid attributes in the standard set provided by ARIA. The two other attributes are indeed valid: `aria-atomic` is part of ARIA Live Regions and `aria-valuetext` can be applied as a human-readable value for custom slider components. It\'s important to reference the [ARIA specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/) when using any role, state, or property to understand its usage and requirements, including ruling out use of any invalid attributes!',

      answer: `Yes, it does! A visible focus indicator is helpful for anyone relying on the keyboard or voice control to navigate to a part of a page and see their focus point on screen.\n\nWithout this affordance, sighted keyboard users and users of voice dictation technology may not have the same understanding when interacting with a page as someone who can see and use a mouse.\n\nTo learn more about visible focus relating to client-side routing and the best characteristics for focus management targets, read an article I wrote on [accessibility in client-side routing](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/2019-07-11-user-testing-accessible-client-routing/)`,

      correct: 'false',
      answer: `It can't - at least not with that alone. If the icon is hard to see or understand, an aria-label would only help users running assistive technology-assuming it had adequate semantics. More visual contrast and possibly a text label may be necessary from a design standpoint as well.`,
