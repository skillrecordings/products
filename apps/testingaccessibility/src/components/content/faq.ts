    question: `How do “seats” work for team purchases?`,
    answer: `When purchasing team seats, you will receive a link that can be used to register one account for every seat you buy. The license is non-transferable (you cannot reassign a licensed seat from one person to another).`,
  },
  {
    question: `Does my company own the team licenses?`,
    answer: `The team licenses are actually single use coupon codes that are distributed to users individually. Companies are not meant to own or keep the licenses. They belong to the individual who claims the coupon code, and cannot be passed around or transferred.`,
  },
  {
    question: `Can I customize the invoice with VAT or other company details?`,
    answer: `Yes, there is a text area for you to add any arbitrary information into a printable PDF.`,
  },
  {
    question: `Do you support Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) / regional licenses?`,
    answer: `Yes! This is automated based on the IP address of the computer you are using to make the purchase. This system isn’t perfect, so the discount does not always display. Note that purchases made with a PPP discount will be restricted to the country they were purchased from and future content and additional materials may not be available.`,
  },
  {
    question: `Can I give a license as a gift?`,
    answer: `Yes! Just enter their email address instead of your own at time of purchase. They may receive a verification code that you would have to request from them. If you are purchasing with a PPP discount, you must both be in the same country or the person receiving the gift will not be able to access the content.`,
  },
  {
    question: `If I buy a lower tier, can I upgrade later?`,
    answer: `Yes! Unless there’s still a discount on the highest tier, you can upgrade by paying the difference at the time you upgrade.`,
  },
  {
    question: `Can I change my email address from the one I bought the course with?`,
    answer: `Yes, by contacting the support team at team@testingaccessibility.com. You cannot transfer your license to another person.`,
  },
  {
    question: `I have a question not covered here. Can I contact someone?`,
    answer: `Yes! You can email the support team at [team@testingaccessibility.com](mailto:team@testingaccessibility.com).`,
  },
