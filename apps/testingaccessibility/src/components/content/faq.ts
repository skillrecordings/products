    question: `What if this material doesn’t suit my needs?`,
    answer: `I guarantee it will, but if it doesn’t, send an email to [team@testingaccessibility.com](mailto:team@testingaccessibility.com) within 30 days for a full refund.`,
  },
  {
    question: `What is the format of the workshops?`,
    answer: `Each workshop contains text-based lessons along with supplemental video clips from a live workshop session to reinforce what you read. The lesson text is not a transcript of the video– it is instructional content that includes challenges with worked out solutions, links to additional resources, and exercises for you to complete on your own.`,
  },
  {
    question: `What if I don’t have (much) development experience?`,
    answer: `Yes! Accessibility is more than just markup. In addition to nuances of ARIA, throughout the workshop I share my thought processes around planning what to test before writing them. There are also several “over the shoulder” videos that include troubleshooting real issues. I even get comments from workshop attendees who learned about DevTools features they didn’t know existed!`,

    question: `What if I don’t have (much) development experience?`,
    answer: `Testing Accessibility’s Core offering includes the Foundations, Design Thinking, and Manual Testing workshops. These workshops introduce the definitions & motivations for accessibility as well as how and where common issues arise. The Manual Testing workshop does also include some optional “fixing” lessons that introduce development topics expanded on in later workshops.`,
  },
  {
    question: `What if I already have experience with accessibility? Will I learn anything?`,
    answer: `Yes! Accessibility is more than just markup. In addition to nuances of ARIA, throughout the workshop I share my thought processes around planning what to test before writing them. There are also several “over the shoulder” videos that include troubleshooting real issues. I even get comments from workshop attendees who learned about DevTools features they didn’t know existed!`,
  },
  {
    question: `What frameworks do you use in the workshops?`,
    answer: `The material in the Foundations and Design & People Skills workshops have lessons that talk about code, but there’s not much writing code. The Manual Testing workshop doesn’t use any frameworks at all when remediating issues— strictly vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. The other development-specific workshops do use React in the demos, but the lessons and tools you learn will be applicable to other frameworks as well. You do not have to know React for 80% of the material, though familiarity would help. Think of React like an implementation detail.`,
  },
  {
    question: `Do I have to know React?`,
    answer: `React’s [JSX syntax](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) is very similar to HTML, and the lessons are clear enough to follow along with and apply to other frameworks. There are some lessons and challenges that involve React-specific features like hooks and portals. Each of these have comparable features in other frameworks, or even vanilla JavaScript if you read React’s source code.`,

  {
    question: `If I buy a lower tier, can I upgrade later?`,
    answer: `Yes! Unless there’s still a discount on the highest tier, you can upgrade by paying the difference at the time you upgrade.`,
  },
  {
    question: `How do “seats” work for team purchases?`,
    answer: `When purchasing team seats, you will receive a link that can be used to register one account for every seat you buy. The license is non-transferable (you cannot reassign a licensed seat from one person to another).`,
  },
  {
    question: `Does my company own the team licenses?`,
    answer: `The team licenses are actually single use coupon codes that are distributed to users individually. Companies are not meant to own or keep the licenses. They belong to the individual who claims the coupon code, and cannot be passed around or transferred.`,
  },
  {
    question: `Can I customize the invoice with VAT or other company details?`,
    answer: `Yes, after purchase there is a text area for you to add any arbitrary information into a printable PDF invoice.`,
  },
  {
    question: `Do you support Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) / regional licenses?`,
    answer: `Yes! This is automated based on the IP address of the computer you are using to make the purchase. This system isn’t perfect, so the discount does not always display. Note that purchases made with a PPP discount will be restricted to the country they were purchased from and future content and additional materials may not be available.`,
  },
  {
    question: `Can I give a license as a gift?`,
    answer: `Yes! Just enter their email address instead of your own at time of purchase. They may receive a verification code that you would have to request from them. If you are purchasing with a PPP discount, you must both be in the same country or the person receiving the gift will not be able to access the content.`,
  },
  {
    question: `Can I change my email address from the one I bought the course with?`,
    answer: `Yes, by contacting the support team at [team@testingaccessibility.com](mailto:team@testingaccessibility.com). You cannot transfer your license to another person.`,
  },
  {
    question: `Can you help me convince my boss to purchase a seat?`,
    answer: `Yes! Check out [an example letter](/boss) here.`,
  },
  {
    question: `I have a question not covered here. Can I contact someone?`,
    answer: ` Yes! Email the support team: team@testingaccesibility.com`,
  },
  {
    question: `What are the terms and conditions?`,
    answer: `You can [read them here](/privacy).`,
