In this workshop, you'll develop the intuition to write effective and efficient tests while building your own testing framework from scratch. This hands-on experience will deepen your understanding and enhance your testing skills.

The workshop is broken out into four parts, each with its own challenges and exercises that build upon the last:

- **Principles:** Mental models behind testing strategies.
- **Test Structure:** Learn how to write and read any test by understanding its three-step structure.
- **Testing Async Code:** Practice testing asynchronous logic, including handling Promise rejections.
- **Migrating to Vitest:** Transition to Vitest after building your mini-testing framework.
