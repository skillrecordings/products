## Not sure if this deal is right for you? Let's talk about how the epic Epic Bundle can change your entire career…

### Ever feel like you're dealing with imposter syndrome?

I hear from developers around the world, doing all kinds of work, at all kinds of companies, and at all stages of their career.

And no matter the language or framework, type of project, or organization… we all face the same struggles, at least some of the time:

Analysis paralysis. When you've mostly learned on the job, or without guiding principles to inform your decisions, even the most experienced get caught in the trap of overanalyzing the details.

Surprise side effects. Or worse, they start making technical decisions without fully understanding the long-term implications.

The technology treadmill. On top of that, technology and industry norms keep changing. How do you make decisions that help you do your job today and take your career to the next level? It's tough to decide when you have…

### The feeling that something is missing
This is the problem that ties the other three together: It feels like something is missing. That's why it's hard to decide and move forward. That's why we experience unintended consequences. That's why we're jumping from tool to tool — or its opposite, sticking with a tool that doesn't quite work, because what if the next choice is worse?

These pains are nearly universal, because…

### Fact: There is something missing
You're not imagining it. But it's not a fault with you at all; this is a problem created by the way we learn and teach web development.

What's missing is the deep understanding not only of how things work, but why. The understanding that goes deeper than any tool, technique, or technical decision.

It's the philosophy that helps you weigh many choices and choose the best one for your situation, your project, your team, your users, your company, your career.

And when you find — build — that something, for yourself… that's when you level up.

When you master your craft, you gain the power of true confidence. The kind of confidence you earn, the kind you can use, the kind that can't be faked.

But you won't get it from traditional courses, workshops, books or tutorials… because they focus on specific how's.

They don't ask, much less answer, the most fundamental question:

## What exactly makes someone a "master" of their craft?

This is a question that feels like it's a lot more complicated than "which database should I use?" or "how do I do $XYZ in React"?

But it's also a much more important question… and in reality, it isn't complicated.

In short: mastery in craft is the difference between knowing how to do something, and knowing how to do anything.

And I don't mean you need to already know the exact way to do any specific "everything" — but that mastery means you have the skills, wisdom, and insight to figure out whatever your work throws at you.

It's like the difference between a solid home cook and a chef:

Any solid cook, with access to the right tools and techniques, can follow a good recipe to create a good meal.

But a chef can spot problems in a poorly written recipe before they even start cooking.

A chef can confidently experiment, solve those problems as they arise, and even create new recipes for any need.

A chef can help others too! Because they know their tools — timing, temperature, methods, ingredients, chemistry, flavor, safety rules — and all the ways they combine, do and don't work; they can go "off-script" at any time.

… cooking and coding actually have a lot in common!

All solid developers can follow a tutorial to solve a specific problem, but true mastery of the craft enables you to do so much more:

- Spot potential problems before they happen
- Confidently experiment with new approaches
- Help others troubleshoot tricky challenges
- Know when to use which tools (and when not to)
- Make decisions from a consistent set of rules and guiding principles
- Break the rules intentionally

That's the kind of mastery most tutorials and lectures can't, or won't, teach you.

But this is exactly the mastery that I designed Epic Web Dev and Epic React to help you build for yourself.

When you enroll in Epic Web, especially, you don't get a book of lectures to watch or "recipes" to follow…

You'll find, and explore, the core rules that underlie all web development tools and techniques.

You'll learn why and how I picked the technologies I did for the Epic Stack. (Maybe you'll use the same guiding principles to choose different ones for your project!)

You learn, step by step, how to understand the guiding principles, skills, and methods of building apps for the web; how to weigh the pros and cons of each situation as you face it, how to decide — and why.

You'll learn how to analyze and think through each new programming problem you face.

And you'll learn all this not from passive listening but while solving active code challenges.

For example:
- Specific example from Epic Web principles about architectural decisions
- Specific example about database choices and tradeoffs
- Specific example about testing strategies

These are the timeless tools of an expert, the ones you'll always need no matter what language and frameworks you use in the future… In fact, I'm so proud of the way that the lessons in Epic Web, especially, go so far beyond the tools list on the curriculum. So many students have written to tell me, "I may not use [X] tool like you do, but what I learned has changed the way I write code with [a completely different tool]."

Yeah, you'll absolutely learn the ins and outs of React, Vitest, Tailwind, Remix, Prisma, and more — but you'll also learn so much more.

You'll learn how to think how I think, not just do what I do.

You'll learn how to master your craft.

And you'll do it while you code: this is the kind of learning that sticks!

I can't stress how impactful it is that EpicWeb.dev teaches not only how to use databases, but also how to get the most out of them. Learn the tricks to have your own 5000x perf improvement

</Testimonial>

## Learn to solve technical problems today, tomorrow, and beyond

This is not a set of courses that will go out-of-date.

Combine Epic Web, Epic React, and the Tailwind and testing workshops and you've got an unstoppable set of tools to advance your skills and career.

You don't have to absorb everything at once. In fact, you probably shouldn't! While some people do binge these courses, many developers tell us something different:

They found immediate solutions to current work challenges. They retain those solutions better than before. They keep coming back to dive deeper, as they grow and encounter new challenges & decisions.

Better than a course you take once and forget most of it, The Epic Bundle becomes their go-to reference, for when building new apps and tackling new challenges.

<Testimonial author={{name: "Abraham Aguilera", image: "https://res.cloudinary.com/epic-web/image/upload/c_thumb,w_200,g_face/v1733091674/abraguilera_.jpg"}} url="https://x.com/abraguilera_/status/1829543104749404206">

One thing that went over my head while going through epic web was how sticky the learnings are. 

It’s been months now and I still have so much recall of the workshops, it’s crazy.  And when something is fuzzy I can go back and use it as reference. A great way to learn

</Testimonial>

I've been a fullstack dev for ~5 years, but there were always areas I never fully grasped.

Kent's EpicWeb.dev demystified those areas and gave me confidence to start my own agency. I couldn't have done it without the knowledge from EpicWeb. Thank you Kent! 🚀
