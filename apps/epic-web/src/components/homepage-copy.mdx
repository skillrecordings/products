Every day as a web developer is a new opportunity. 

An opportunity to make endless expert decisions about what you'll build and how you'll build it.

Before you even sit down and actually write code.

Bad decisions cost time and money.Everybody suffers when the wrong decisions are made. Your customers, your co-workers, and you.

There's nothing worse than waking up to every day to work on a poorly engineered project.

Your early decisions affect your project for its entire lifecycle. 

Years! Sometimes even decades.

It's critical to get it right when people are relying on you to make the right decisions.

1. Application Architecture
2. Data Modeling
3. API Design
4. Component Architecture
5. Layout and Styling
6. Testing
7. State Management
8. Code Generation
9. Deployment Strategy

There are SO many decisions to make and most of them are vital to the success of your project.

## That's where Epic Web comes in.
