Testing can feel like a never-ending battle. 

You pour time and effort into writing tests, only to be left with a brittle, unreliable test suite that fails unexpectedly and makes refactoring a nightmare. You're left questioning the value of your tests and wondering if there's a better way.

Sound familiar? 

You're not alone. 

Many developers struggle with:

<CrossList>

- Understanding what and how to mock effectively
- Writing tests that are resilient to changes in implementation details
- Maintaining tests that provide real value and confidence in the codebase
- Keeping up with the latest testing techniques and best practices

</CrossList>

It's no wonder testing often feels like a frustrating chore rather than a valuable tool.

<h2 className="text-center pt-5 font-bold pb-5 text-balance dark:text-foreground text-emerald-950">Imagine a World Where Testing Is Your Superpower</h2>

What if instead of dreading testing, you looked forward to it? 

Imagine writing tests that:

<CheckList>

- Give you **peace of mind**, knowing your code won't break things in unexpected ways
- Catch **bugs** before they become critical issues
- Make refactoring **stress-free**
- Act as a **guide** for how your code should behave
- Encourage **cleaner, simpler code** by making you think through edge cases from the start
- Help you **sleep better at night** 

</CheckList>

In this world, testing is a superpower that lets you ship high-quality TypeScript code with speed and confidence.

<WorkshopAppScreenshot />
<br/>

The Epic Web experience isn't sitting and watching videos.

Each workshop is contained within a specially designed web app that contains all of the exercises, code, and instructions you need to complete the workshop. The app is tightly integrated with your local development environment, so you can code and test your work in real time, in your real world work environment.

If you ever find yourself getting stuck, you have easy access to resources and diffs to help you get back on track. You'll also be invited to join the Epic Web community, where you can ask questions, share your progress, and even find a cohort to work through the workshop with.

After completing a workshop module, you'll be able to download a certificate of completion. Each certificate is served with a mechanism that proves to your team, your manager, or your future employer that you actually did the work. Share it with pride. You earned it.

- **Rising Full-Stack Devs:** Get the foundations right.
- **Veteran Coders:** Fill in the knowledge gaps you didn't know you had.

As an experienced engineer, I get the most value from seeing how Kent makes decisions and trade-offs while following best practices to build real-world apps. This stuff is gold dust, and it's super hard to find in online courses!

</Testimonial>

<Testimonial author={{name: "Dev Neill", image: "https://res.cloudinary.com/epic-web/image/upload/v1697541719/testimonials/devneill.jpg"}} url="https://twitter.com/devneill/status/1712844344409948538">

I've been a fullstack dev for ~5 years, but there were always areas I never fully grasped.

Kent's EpicWeb.dev demystified those areas and gave me confidence to start my own agency. I couldn't have done it without the knowledge from EpicWeb. Thank you Kent! ðŸš€
