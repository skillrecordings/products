It can’t be done.

Too much to learn.

Full-stack web development is daunting. It’s often hard to describe what full-stack even means. It’s layers of complexity beyond what is typically described as “front-end” and “back-end” development?

At this point in modern web development it’s challenging to understand where the front stops and the back begins, and there is a pile of things that sit in between.

Layout, styling, data modeling, UI components, design systems, user input, service orchestration, databases, deployment, testing, tooling, developer experience, and so many other aspects to a truly FULL stack.

Maybe they are right. Maybe it is impossible.

Maybe not.

What if you could learn everything from the front, back, and center of the stack and be empowered to design and ship software end-to-end?

Epic Web Dev is your complete guide to full-stack web development that works from first principles to fully-tested, production-ready, modern, maintainable web applications that you can deploy with confidence and are a joy to work on.

Thousands of developers have learned career changing skills through Epic React and Testing JavaScript, my other two courses. Epic Web Dev will apply the same integrity and commitment to high-quality real-world developer education.

But it’s more ambitious, more complete, and not focused on a single technology.

Epic Web Dev will teach you how to think like a full-stack web developer and give you the experience and confidence you need to step in and solve the hard problems that go with that responsibility.

This is my most ambitious project that I’ve ever committed to, and I’m excited to share my progress and build it in public with you.

    <Balancer className="text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-br from-white to-gray-400 leading-[1.1]">
      {
        'Epic Web Dev is going to be designed and produced as a series of real-world exercise focused workshops.'
      }
    </Balancer>
  </h2>
</div>

<p className="text-center pb-10 pt-10">{'A lot of them!'}</p>

This is going to be the equivalent of a bootcamp, but designed to allow you to work through it at your own pace focusing on what you currently want or need to learn. You’ll be able to track your progress through the course, and get access to my favorite curated resources to support and extend your learning experience.

This isn’t a series of videos you can hit autoplay on, kick back, and hope to learn by osmosis.

Epic Web Dev isn’t hopeful. It’s in depth. Hard work. Serious. And totally achievable.

In each of the workshops you will be building authentic examples with a focused set of learning outcomes so that you will understand what you will learn and how you can apply them to your professional work.

Each example app is professionally focused and aligned with the problem spaces that modern web applications are built to solve.

This means that you’ll be developing problem solving experience across the full-stack.

While Epic Web Dev is a self-paced course, you will explore the different facets of web application development and the various roles you can expect to encounter on a team. Most web applications aren’t built by a single web developer, and as a full-stack developer you should be able to gain flexibility and the ability to add value at all layers of a professional dev team.

<div className="py-24">

Right now Epic Web Dev is just kicking off. My team and I are planning and designing the learning material and example applications.

If you’d like to follow along, participate in live streams where I’ll be building the examples and practicing the workshop material you can sign up below and I’ll notify you!

It’s going to be epic, and I’m looking forward to exploring full-stack web development with you.
