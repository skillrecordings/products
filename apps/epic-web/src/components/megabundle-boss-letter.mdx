Dear Boss,

We're asking for licenses to the Epic Megabundle - the most complete collection of developer workshops ever created by Kent C. Dodds. This is not a sit-on-your-butt-and-watch-lectures bundle. This is a learn-with-your-hands-on-the-keyboard bundle with over 500 exercises across 31 workshops.

These workshops will help our team master our craft, moving us beyond just knowing how to do something to knowing how to do anything. When you master your craft, you gain the power of true confidence - the kind of confidence you earn, the kind you can use, the kind that can't be faked.

Developers who complete these workshops consistently report that:
- They retain solutions better than before
- They understand WHY decisions are made, not just WHAT to do
- They feel more confident making technical decisions
- They can apply these principles to new situations

This special offer ends at Midnight (Pacific) on Thursday, December 19th. This is the perfect opportunity to spend down our remaining 2024 learning budget and invest in our skills for 2025.

If you're ready to support our team's development, please visit https://epicweb.dev/megabundle-2024 to purchase our licenses.

Thank you for considering this investment in our growth.

â€” your team
