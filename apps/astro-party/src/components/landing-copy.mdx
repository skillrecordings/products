The best feeling in the world is shipping something and seeing folks in your community enjoy what you’ve built. Whether you’re a big company, a small team, or an individual, the ultimate goal is to translate the great ideas we have into a shareable project that others can use, enjoy, and benefit from.

Our choices, then, should optimize for shipping faster and more confidently. Less messing with config; more merging to production. Less late-night bug fixing; more launch parties.

Astro is a tool that strives to set good defaults, then get out of the way so you can ship web projects fast, knowing that you will:

- Ship with better core web vitals by default compared to other frameworks
- Build with best-in-class developer experience using your component-based framework of choice — or no framework at all
- Ship zero JS by default
- Intelligently hydrate only the dynamic parts of your site to build anything from simple interactions up to highly complex apps

The web is at its best when we’re having fun with it. Astro’s here to help make the web a party.

## Learn how Astro makes us better and faster at shipping for the web by default

Astro Party is a carefully curated deep dive into Astro, designed for ramping up busy professional devs on what makes Astro special and how to take full advantage of its features in as little as a few hours. Go from zero to productive fast so you can join the party!

In this course, you’ll learn:

- How to create and deploy Astro sites
- Why Astro sites outperform other frameworks on core web vitals on average
- How to build pages using content from Markdown, APIs, content management systems, and more
- How to set up API routes, RSS feeds, and other common needs
- How to add dynamic functionality with your favorite framework, including React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, Lit, and more
- How partial hydration works and why it’s better for users
- How to share state between partially hydrated components (and even between frameworks!)
- How to enable server-rendering and other advanced use cases

By the time you’ve completed this course, you’ll know how to build just about anything for the web using Astro’s powerfully simple APIs and industry-leading developer experience.

Learning Astro allows you to spend all your coding time and mental energy on building out your vision instead of fine-tuning your tools.

Astro Party will show you and your team how to **leverage the web dev skills you already have to build faster web experiences in time frames that sound impossible.**

## Are you ready to party?

If you build for the web, Astro is a tool well worth adding to your toolbox whether you need to stand up a quick landing page, or migrate your company’s blog or shop to an architecture that’s easier to maintain, faster to update, and snappier for customers to load.

With simple APIs that level up less experienced developers and give full control to seasoned pros, Astro has found the right balance of abstracting away the “undifferentiated labor” of building for the web while still giving us full control over building out exactly what we want using exactly the combination of dev tools we love.

Want to use CSS Modules? It’s built in. Prefer Tailwind? The integration just works. Use your favorite frameworks, styling tools, and so much more with a few CLI commands, and spend your time actually building something valuable instead of wrestling with your tools.

I’ve been building for the web for twenty years, creating online experiences for clients and employers ranging from local sandwich shops to IBM, from independent online clothing brands to high-tech startups.

I host a show called _Learn With Jason_ where I pair program with the web’s leading experts to learn new technologies and tools, and I regularly create educational content to help developers learn new ways to build for the web.

I’ve tried just about every approach out there for building websites, and I use that experience to provide pragmatic, practical guidance that skips hype and trendiness in search of what actually matters: what will this tool help us build?

Astro is proving itself to be a powerful tool for builders. So let me be the first to invite you to the Astro Party. Let’s build something cool together.
