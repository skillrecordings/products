For a lot of frontend developers, the back of the stack feels like a _black box_—a mysterious, and often scary discipline.

But if your goal is to be a well-rounded engineer, you’ll need a comprehensive understanding of what is happening on the server and in your databases.

If you want to claim the elusive title of full-stack developer and climb higher up the engineering career ladder, **this message is for you.**

To be proficient in backend development, you need to understand:

<ThingsToUnderstand />

**And so much more...**

This may seem like a lot, and trying to go it alone can feel overwhelming.

The good news?
