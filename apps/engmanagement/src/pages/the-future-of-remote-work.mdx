  There has been a lot of chatter of late about what previously on-premises
  companies will do as more of the population is vaccinated. Will they ask
  everyone to return to commuting to an office? Can they? What are the impacts?
</p>

The pandemic created lasting effects on the nature of work, and some questions remain: what will this new normal look like? This topic is nuanced and has many impacts: cultural, financial, personal, and thus, is a divided and hard-hitting topic. It’s also one worth exploring with some depth and thought.

I’ve managed remote teams for many years now, and while I absolutely don’t think it’s the one true way to work (if such a thing exists), we should spend a moment talking through this issue from the perspective of leading a team and the nuances to keep in mind while making these decisions.

My personal feeling is that a hybrid remote and in-person model can be a great compromise. The way this works best is to gather information and listen first to really understand the problem at hand. We’ll break down arguments on both sides and talk through a few versions of what a hybrid model would look like as well as some tips to make one successful.

## What’s happening?

As Laurie mentions in a subsequent tweet, when 27% of this quick pulse of tech folks on twitter people say they'll **_quit_** if they can’t work remotely, we’re looking at a seismic shift in the industry.

It’s not just this poll- some are calling this phenomenon _The Great Resignation_. According to recent research by Microsoft, 41% of the global workforce is thinking about leaving their current jobs. [This podcast by LinkedIn](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-great-resignation/id1453893304?i=1000526225709) explores how the pandemic has not just gotten folks used to remote work, but caused a lot of people to take a step back and examine their needs. Experts in leadership like Suzan Bond are [exploring what this means for leaders as well](https://observationsandannotations.substack.com/p/what-the-great-resignation-means).

<section className="lg:-mx-10 sm:-mx-5 -mx-2 sm:px-10 px-5 bg-black sm:py-6 py-4 rounded-lg shadow-xl bg-opacity-90 sm:my-16 my-10">

For instance, we can see an example of this with [Apple’s workers appealing to the company by writing an internal memo](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4) requesting location-flexible employment. Google has also become more flexible in policy and is [seeing thousands of its workforce opt for a pay cut](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/google-remote-work-pay-adjustments/) so that they can retain remote working privileges.

And indeed, there are some very good reasons that people may be interested in this:

- It’s more inclusive of all workers: folks with disabilities, people who need to care for their families or loved ones, non-neurotypical people
- People don’t feel that they’re wasting time on a commute
- Folks that are introverts are more comfortable/productive (meaning: you _can_ be social, but you get your energy from being isolated- while extroverts get their energy from being around people)
- Focus-driven tasks like long sessions of coding can be easier for some people
- Reduced spread of disease and pathogens
- The Bay Area is very expensive in terms of housing, opening up remote work means opening a broader talent pool around the world and more affordable living scenarios for many.

</section>

A point made in the Apple memo, is that now working this way isn’t an abstract concept: **they have proven that they can ship well without being in the office**. This has been a sentiment shared widely from tech workers whose jobs don’t require in-person work.

## So, what’s different?

One thing is very important to be clear on: **remote work is not remote work in a pandemic**. It’s incredible that people can ship while dealing with the harrowing mental effects and fear that a global crisis can bring, often while completely adjusting their lives at home. Taking care of family members that usually don’t need care during the day, working in spaces not designed for work, I think we can all give ourselves a hearty pat on the back for the last year and a half, we certainly deserve it.

But managing remote teams sans pandemic is not the same path. Leading a remote team in non-pandemic times means not simply _conceding_ to circumstances, but _purposefully building teams_ around communication preferences that favor a remote world.

**It also offers something the pandemic did not**: **majority remote work but periodic in-person meetups** to do the kind of communication work that may take a day or two, all together, such as an offsite.

When working remotely is punctuated with periods of in-person collaboration, it allows them to build bonds that carry over to working in different locations.

## “But what if I like working in an office?”

If your preference is to work in an office, you may be following the remote work debate and feeling like _you're_ not included. Everyone has different working styles, and there are very good reasons for wanting to be back in the office as well, including but not limited to:

- Not having a comfortable space for working at home: perhaps there’s no dedicated space and your work is taking over the kitchen, perhaps they are living with others and it’s too distracting to work with so much noise around.
- Some people are extroverts and do their best work with the energy of other people around them.
- Some people are introverts and like to get small doses of communication with a team without the “pressure to perform”, to feel connected.
- Some people get good thinking work/reading done on a commute.

All of these reasons are completely valid. Typically in any group, you’ll see a combination of people who want to work from home and want to go into an office.

<section className="lg:-mx-10 sm:-mx-5 -mx-2 sm:px-10 px-5 bg-black sm:py-6 py-4 rounded-lg shadow-xl bg-opacity-90 sm:my-16 my-10">

There are also, unfortunately, fear-based reasons some folks at the managerial level may be concerned with being in an office. After speaking to quite a few leaders at companies large and small, here are some of the reasons folks at the top might be pushing back:

- **That people may be taking advantage of remote work to not work their full hours**.<br/>
  To this I would say: does it matter? If they are able to get their work done, they do not need to occupy a warm seat for a length of time to do so. If they are not able to get their work done, is that much different from if they weren’t doing so in-office?
- **That once people have the opportunity to work remotely, they may not ever want to go back**.<br/>
  To which I would say, maybe this is ok too- I suggest some practical applications below.
- **That team dynamics will suffer irrevocably**.<br/>
  I feel sympathy for this argument. Managing a team can be tough, very draining work, and feeling like your team’s morale is unraveling can make a person feel like they’re sinking. When a team disconnects from one another and you don’t feel like you know how to help, it can be a frustrating and sad situation. It’s true that sometimes those mirror neurons that fire when you see another human face to face can, at times, remind people that they’re talking to another person rather than an avatar.

However, being in each other’s space all day each day can also cause trouble- have you ever sat next to someone with a tick that bothered you? It can feel a little oppressive if you feel that there are some things you can’t escape from.

When we spend all day today together rain or shine, there can be a loss of perspective. There’s a possibility that some conflicts feel very “big” when you’re in an office all day long, as compared to being in a space that allows some time for breaks and playing with pets.

Most, if not all of us who worked in engineering orgs with open floor plans remember lines and lines of desks with engineers with noise-cancelling headphones on, trying to block out the noise well enough to gain an ounce of focus.

Truly, there are pros and cons each way. So what’s to be done?

## Hybrid and Flexible Work

Personally, I don’t see any reason why accommodating everyone can’t be possible. Really.

At one company I’ve worked for, we had a mostly remote culture, with some folks at a headquarters office coming into the office a couple of preplanned days a week, like Monday and Wednesday for instance. This only applied to the people who lived in the area, the rest of the company was fully remote, though some companies have “hub” locations around the world to gather those who are in the same area.

While the cadence isn’t really important, this did allow for many different styles of working, and the coordinated office days helped the office not feel like a ghost town when people decided to go in. And the office was always open on the weekdays if people felt like going in more. This is just one approach, but it did work for a lot of the staff.

At another larger company, we worked remotely, and met up with our team during pre-planned offsites for several days. Those touchpoints of seeing one another carried some trust forward into video meetings and further remote work. The ratio of in-person doesn’t need to be incredibly frequent to retain some of that camaraderie if done with care.

## Making the hybrid model work for you

<section className="lg:-mx-10 sm:-mx-5 -mx-2 sm:px-10 px-5 bg-black sm:py-6 py-4 rounded-lg shadow-xl bg-opacity-90">

Here are some of the things I have noted through trial and error over the years that helped hybrid working styles to be successful:

- When people are in meetings with both people in-person, and folks dialing in, everyone should still use their computer to share their faces (all on mute, save one computer or meeting device to reduce echo). Prior to landing on this approach, you could have in the office speaking in a room at each other in tones and in a direction that the half that were dialing in remotely couldn’t hear or see. This allowed the in-person folks to feel connected and the remote people to feel included.
- Cultivating a purposeful async culture. This means finding the right communication modality for what you’re working on. Such as discoverable notes, and good internal documentation. Slack for immediate messages, email for longer, dense messages. Multiple types of communication and repetition for something really important. This is honestly great to have anyways, even if you’re in the office. Silly things like company-specific emojis, memes, traditions, and jokes allow work to have a bit more levity, being clear about communication and timing expectations, and onboarding people properly and giving them a place/person to ask questions to so that they don’t feel lost. It’s one of those examples where being inclusive of some means improvements for all.
- You don’t need as much office space, and funds can be reallocated to help people’s home work space be improved, if that’s how they choose to work. You’re no longer trying to house everyone at the company, but only the portion that regularly comes in. For company-wide all hands events, it’s possible to rent the space needed for everyone. Bonus: depending on your burn rate, it can be in a beautiful spot since it’s a bit more rare.
- Your talent pool widens to… great people from around the world! This can give a leg up on your competition. With a hybrid working environment that includes folks from different time zones, it’s great to isolate what the overlap is between working hours, and suggest that people leave that strip of time open for meetings, while otherwise giving a more flexible working schedule. This can be a great compromise for people who can absolutely get their work done at their own pace, but do need to collaborate with others, too.

## Growing and Nurturing a Team in the New Normal

None of these suggestions are hard and fast rules, it’s most important that whatever it is, works for you, and hopefully the widest range of people at the company. I personally believe in hybrid approaches because those who want to be in the office can be, and those who do not, don’t have to.

This means being purposeful about what you are doing, but being in an office in the first place was designed initially with some purpose. **Offices are a human invention like the telephone, they don’t exist naturally.** **Therefore, with some thought, we can iterate on this paradigm and create new environments for working people.**

One thing is sure: the world of work in tech now is not the same as the one pre-pandemic. **Workers are reflecting more on their needs and worth, and management should adjust, listen, and honor this, or stand to see large impacts on retention and productivity**. This isn’t a bad thing! Managers should always strive to understand what a good, balanced work environment means for those around us, and try to find good compromises between what the business and its people need to do the best work possible.

My suggestion is to have frank conversations with employees and/or take anonymous surveys of people’s thoughts and opinions (in case they are worried about speaking their mind due to power dynamics). Getting a pulse on how people are feeling helps, as well as gathering data on impacts. This can really help guide decision-making processes. Remember, you can also try things out as well. There’s nothing wrong with doing a trial period and adjusting based on team needs.

It may seem to be a hard problem, but it’s completely doable to find balance and equilibrium! It takes some care, honesty, and adjustment, but as long as we’re thoughtful, we can create great cultures and productive workforces moving forward.
