Wading through **hours** of video transcripts to find the most important information is tedious, grueling, and prone to error. Even with short videos, this can be a pain.

There are tools and services to help with this, but they are slow, complicated, and not tailored to **your** needs and content workflows.

But you can code! Why do you need to suffer from whatever solutions are out there when you can build your own?

That's easier said than done, but what if you could have a well defined set of tools that made it easier to process transcripts, extract insights, and develop worflows that are customized to your content and business?

That's what Transcript Automation is all about. We will show you how to script and automate the process of extracting insights from your video transcripts so that you can remix and repurpose your video content in ways that maximize your reach while reducing the time you spend on content creation.
