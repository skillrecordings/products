# Total TypeScript Learning Path

**Goal**: Learn the TypeScript skills you need to ship any application or library.

**Curriculum**: https://totaltypescript.com/products/core-volume

**Requirements**:

- Basic knowledge of JavaScript
- Internet Access
- Access to the Core Volume of Total TypeScript

**Total Time Required**: 22-52 hours (varies)

**Background**: The tutorials and workshops were designed and tested as half-day workshops
before being produced as a full-length self-paced course. The course is designed to be
completed in 13 weeks, but you can go at your own pace. We estimate that it will take
about 2-4 hours per week to complete the course content. 

**Teams**: Learning as a team, club, or party is highly recommended. We've seen great results
with teams of 2-4 people. We suggest that learning teams watch and work through the course 
before meeting once a week to discuss what they've learned in the shared context of the
team. We've found that this approach is more effective than watching the course together
as a group!
