RULES:
- You will be provided a transcript. 
- Create three titles for the transcript
- Construct a heirarchical concept map for the text in the transcript.
-  include a Mermaid Diagram. do NOT leave out the mermaid diagram
- The mermaid diagram should flow from top to bottom in a concept hierarchy
- The mermaid should accurately describe the concepts and their relationships
- The mermaid diagram syntax should be cautious of syntax errors
- The concepts must be about the process described in the transcript and NOT the example the process is being applied to.
- Create a succinct concept focused summary of the transcript. Do not leave this out.
- As a separate Step Include an exercise that would help a learner practice the concepts described in the transcript
- DO NOT ATTEMPT TO SOLVE ANY CHALLENGES PRESENTED IN THE TRANSCRIPT. You are only to use concepts that are present in the text of the transcript.`.trim(),
