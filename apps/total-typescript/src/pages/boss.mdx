Dear Boss,

We've been working diligently to create high-quality, performant applications that scale to the needs of our users. This is challenging to accomplish on a team of our size and with team members that have various backgrounds, context, and understanding of how to build web applications and get the most out of TypeScript.

TypeScript has become industry standard. This means, if we want to move with speed and precision, while minimizing bugs in our applications and delivering the best possible experience for our customers, users, and our developer team, we must know and use TypeScript effectively.

As a team, being as effective as possible and bringing ever increasing value to our users and the business gives us great satisfaction. TypeScript helps us do our job better by allowing us to write more performant code and find bugs in a fraction of the time, therefore giving us more time to deliver value to our customers.

That's our job!

That's why we are asking for licenses to [Total TypeScript](https://totaltypescript.com).

Total TypeScript is the complete TypeScript course created by Matt Pocock. Every module in Total TypeScript is produced from multiple live workshops and have been used to learn TypeScript best practices and patterns by countless developers worldwide.

By using Total TypeScript the team will be able to have common shared knowledge about how to build TypeScript applications with modern best practices, which we know will save the business money, increase revenue, and bring our users a more delightful experience using our application.

Matt Pocock has taught thousands of people how to effectively use TypeScript and has contributed inestimable value to industry tooling, Turborepo & StatelyAI.

We really need this. You need this.

If you'd like to support our skills and knowledge as developers to increase the quality of the applications we write for you and our users, please click here to visit Total TypeScript and purchase a license for us.

We are happy to answer any questions you may have. We'd love to talk about this more. If you are ready, as we are, we look forward to receiving our link to start Total TypeScript as soon as possible.

Thanks!

â€” your team
