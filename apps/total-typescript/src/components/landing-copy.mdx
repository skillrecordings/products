You could spend that time building new features or bugfixes. You could be providing value. Instead, you're fighting TypeScript.

These days, TypeScript is an industry default. If you’re starting an enterprise app today, you’ll need a good reason NOT to use TypeScript.

So you keep on pushing - all the time feeling like you’re working against TypeScript, not with it.

The truth is that you never truly learned TypeScript, at least not in depth. That's the source of your pain.

You never developed a systematic approach to solving type errors.

You never developed a mental model for understanding when to use <span className="text-rose-400">any</span>.

You never understood the power of generics.

Ultimately…

**You never learned the underlying principles and patterns of being an effective TypeScript engineer.**

Instead of sitting through hours of lectures, you'll be presented with problematic code and a concise explanation of what needs to be done.

Then using your existing skills along helpful links to relevant docs and other resources, you'll have as much time as you need to complete the challenge either in your local editor or using the editor embedded into each lesson.

When you're ready, you can watch how a true TypeScript Wizard approaches solving the challenge.

The exercises build upon another, demonstrating the most important TypeScript concepts in a variety different contexts so you can build understanding of when, where, and how to best apply them in your own application and library code.

What’s the thing that separates TypeScript wizards from the rest?

Understanding.

To them, TypeScript doesn’t feel like magic. It feels simple, predictable and malleable.

They can bend it to their will, and use its power for amazing DX.

Total TypeScript is all about building that understanding at a deep level.

When you’ve completed the exercises, you’ll reach a point of mastery where very little surprises you any more.

You’ll have less fear when approaching nasty TypeScript errors, more confidence when typing dynamic signatures, gain velocity by cutting lines of code, and so much more.

  Who is Total TypeScript for?
</h3>

Total TypeScript is suitable for any developer who is ready to work at becoming a wizard, though some basic familiarity with TypeScript is recommended.

The Type Transformations workshop begins by warming you up with exercises on basic inference and essential types.

Then nearly 150 exercises later, the Advanced TypeScript Patterns workshop will have you creating chainable method abstractions with generics and the builder pattern.

Check out the free [Beginner's Tutorial](/tutorials/beginners-typescript) to set a foundation and get an idea for the workshop's teaching approach.

    <Testimonial author={{name: 'John D. Jameson', image: require('../../public/testimonials/john-d-jameson.jpg')}}>

    I’m really digging Total TypeScript by Matt Pocock. It’s taking all the random TypeScript knowledge I’ve found in docs and Stack Overflow over the years and showing how it all works under the hood. Highly recommended!

    </Testimonial>

    <Testimonial author={{name: 'Adam Rackis', image: require('../../public/testimonials/adam-rackis.jpg')}}>

    You know those kung fu movies where the hero has a training montage beating the shit out of a tree so he can get good & murder his enemy?

    That's what Matt Pocock's Total TypeScript is like. Except TS instead of Kung Fu. And Jira tickets instead of your enemy. Anyway it's great

    </Testimonial>

    <Testimonial author={{name: 'Andrew C.', image: require('../../public/testimonials/andrew-cherniavskii.jpeg')}}>

    The challenges were not too easy, and some of them took me a fair amount of time to find a working solution. This ultimately helped me to better understand TypeScript!

    </Testimonial>

    <Testimonial author={{name: 'Mr. Steal Your Code', image: require('../../public/testimonials/mr-steal-your-code.jpg')}}>

    Matt Pocock is saving my life with his Total TypeScript course. Can't tell you how many other videos I've watched that didn't click as much as his have. Looking forward to the more advanced courses.

Matt’s mastery of the subject and ability to explain the more complex parts of TypeScript in an understandable way have fundamentally changed and expanded my understanding of the language. While I do think it will take a bit of time to fully process everything I’ve just learned, I definitely feel armed with the knowledge and resources I need to solve <code className="!bg-gray-700 rounded !px-1 py-0.5">any</code> TypeScript problem in front of me. Thank you, Matt for all of the work you put into this!

Before creating Total TypeScript, I was a member of the XState core team and worked as a developer advocate at Vercel.

I've worked with TypeScript as a lead fullstack dev, a library maintainer, and now as a full-time educator.

I built Total TypeScript to make the secrets of open-source maintainers and industry experts available to everyone.

Many problems in TypeScript come down to transforming types into other types.

This workshop is your first step on the path to wizardry with topics including unions, template literals, conditional types and mapped types. You'll also see how to take advantage of inference and type helpers to ensure you retain flexibility while ensuring your types are exactly how you expect them to be.

</Module>

<Module title="TypeScript Generics" slug="typescript-generics" metaLabel="49 lessons" sub="Unlock amazing inference in the functions you create and the abstractions you build" image="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/z9io1e0u/production/12ef51ed533404ccf132765c75be8b6fe600bcda-769x769.png">

Generics are one of TypeScript's most complex and intimidating features.

Getting good at generics requires deep knowledge of the TypeScript Compiler, as well as an understanding of how their placement impacts their usefulness.

You'll practice with using generics in a variety of situations, as well as how to use function overloads when generics aren't the best fit.

</Module>

<Module title="Advanced TypeScript Patterns" slug="advanced-typescript-patterns" metaLabel="45 lessons" sub="Become fluent in TypeScript's undocumented patterns" image="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/z9io1e0u/production/ce94d457bbfa7580dd803aaa5630a7c6ebed9fee-927x927.png">

The TypeScript community has discovered and iterated upon several patterns that build on the type transformation and generics techniques explored in the earlier workshops.

Here you'll grow more powerful through practice with branded types and the builder pattern, among others. You will also discover the best practices for strongly typing the global scope and how to understand the flow of generics through external libraries.

</Module>

<Module title="Advanced React with TypeScript" slug="advanced-react-with-typescript" metaLabel="57 lessons" sub="Expert-level knowledge for typing your React apps with TypeScript" image="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/z9io1e0u/production/bb6a657e3e8d8a8dc4d66783d23a56797b22b882-1200x1200.png">

Using TypeScript with React can be tricky, requiring flexible, type-safe, and structured components.

This workshop empowers developers to combine React and TypeScript effectively. It covers advanced props handling, leveraging TypeScript generics for components and hooks, safer React hooks using types, understanding the TypeScript type system, recognizing industry-standard patterns, and safely integrating external libraries into React components.

</Module>

<Module title="TypeScript Pro Essentials" slug="typescript-pro-essentials" metaLabel="200 lessons" sub="Elevate your TypeScript proficiency with precision, clean coding practices, error prevention, and scalable project development" image="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/z9io1e0u/production/80da574ffbb12904f823723d5ea0a8e20add0270-1200x1200.png">

Whether you're new to TypeScript or looking to refine your skills, this workshop covers over 200 lessons across 17 sections. From essential IDE setup and TypeScript fundamentals to advanced type manipulation and best practices for scalable application development, gain the knowledge and confidence to write cleaner code, preempt errors, and elevate your projects effectively. Explore the nuances of TypeScript configuration, enhance your understanding of object-oriented principles, and optimize your development environment with industry-leading insights.
