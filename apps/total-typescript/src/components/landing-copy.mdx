The feature’s working. The tests are passing. But your IDE is a sea of red lines. TypeScript’s not happy again.

You move on to the next error:

<TypeError>

{`Element implicitly has an ‘any’ type because expression of type ‘string’ can’t be used to index type ‘{ string: string | undefined; }’`}

<br />
<br />
{`No index signature with a parameter of type ‘string’ was found on type ‘{ string: string | undefined; }’`}

</TypeError>

“WTF is this?” you think to yourself.

Every search result is either "here are 100 lines of adapter garbage" or "here's a solution that doesn't work”

You contemplate the absurd amount of hours you spend solving these problems.

You'd rather swallow shards of glass than deal with another:

<TypeError >

The intersection '{0}' was reduced to 'never' because property '{1}' has conflicting types in some constituents.

</TypeError>

or

<TypeError>

Return type of exported function has or is using name '{0}' from external module {1} but cannot be named.

</TypeError>

Your time is precious. You have bigger fish to fry.

Perhaps, you could spend that time writing new libraries or pushing technology forwards in other areas of your organization. Instead, you're dealing with TypeScript’s bs.

No one ever said, "let's build large-scale enterprise applications with vanilla JS."

But not using TypeScript is not an option.

So you keep on pushing - all the time feeling like you’re working against TypeScript, not with it.

The truth is that you never truly learned TypeScript, at least not in depth.

That's the source of your pain.

That's the source of your lack of velocity and impact.

You never developed a systematic approach to solving type errors.

You never got to know the power of generics.

Ultimately…

You never learned the underlying principles and patterns of being an effective TypeScript engineer.

## You deserve so much better.

You deserve a practical, systematic approach to learning TypeScript in depth.

That's why I'm creating Total TypeScript.

It combines everything I've learned as a TS engineer and OSS maintainer for XState.

This course will be massive… actually I should call it something else because "course" doesn't capture the scope and depth of training it will provide.

We'll be covering all the principals and patterns the docs don't cover.

We'll start at an beginner level and reach a super-advanced level.

It's going to be the most advanced TypeScript course on the market.

It will turn you into your company's resident TypeScript Wizard:

- the one that gives guidance and unlocks others
- the one that leads large-scale Typescript initiatives
- the one that consistently pushes teams within your company forward

This collection of workshops will move you from being a contributor to a TypeScript codebase to being "the TypeScript wizard" for your team.

## A Systematic Approach for Learning TypeScript

### Fundamentals

Complexity and ambiguity compound exponentially. To learn "XY" concept, you must first master X and Y separately and in-depth.

We'll go through all the fundamentals of advanced TypeScript.

We'll look at generics, conditional types, mapped types, tuples - everything you need to feel confident looking at complicated TypeScript code.

### Challenge-Driven

From there, we'll work through the Type challenges - a list of over 100 TypeScript challenges that offer a stern test for advanced TypeScript users.

This will be a problem/solution setup - I'll set up the problem, then let you have a go at the solution.

This will test your TypeScript muscles and give you a massive, comprehensive set of challenges to work through with my guidance at your side.

### OSS-Driven

Finally, we'll look at TypeScript in the wild.

I've got interviews lined up with several open source library maintainers who will guide you through ~10 of the top TypeScript Open Source repositories out there.

We'll focus on the principals they used to solve their hardest TypeScript challenges - and the architectural decisions that led them there.

## Concrete, no-bs, "this is your new superpower" Outcomes.

This course is all about learning deeply as opposed to quickly.

The result is mastery.

Once you've completed Total TypeScript, you will have less fear when approaching nasty TypeScript errors, more confidence when typing dynamic signatures, gain velocity by cutting lines of code, and so much more!

Ultimately, you will be able to make TypeScript work for you, not against you.
