Dear Boss,

Our team strives to create high-quality, performant applications that scale to our users' needs. This is challenging with team members of varied backgrounds and different levels of TypeScript expertise.

TypeScript has become the industry standard way to write JavaScript for the web. To move with speed and precision while minimizing bugs, we must know and use TypeScript effectively as a team.

When we master TypeScript, we can:
- Catch errors before they reach users, through compile-time type checking
- Make updates and refactors with confidence 
- Write clearer, more maintainable code
- Spend less time fixing bugs and more time delivering value
- Improve the development experience for our whole team

That's why we are asking for licenses to [Total TypeScript](https://totaltypescript.com).

Total TypeScript is a comprehensive training program created by Matt Pocock. It includes:
- 400+ hands-on coding exercises across 5 workshops
- A clear path from beginner to expert in 26 weeks or less
- Brief, focused lessons that fit into our daily work
- Lifetime access to all materials
- Team-wide access to the same high-quality learning resources

The program helps teams develop shared knowledge of TypeScript best practices and patterns, which will:
- Save development time through better tooling and fewer bugs
- Improve code quality and maintainability
- Enable faster, more confident updates and refactors
- Create a better experience for our users

Matt Pocock has taught thousands of developers how to use TypeScript effectively and has contributed significantly to industry tooling, including Turborepo & StatelyAI.

If you'd like to support our development as a team and increase the quality of our applications, please visit Total TypeScript to purchase licenses for us.

We're happy to answer any questions you have and would love to discuss this further.

Thank you for considering this investment in our team's capabilities.

â€” your team
