So, you won't be able to use snippets, \"setSelectedText\", and other keyboard-related features. I'd recommend AutoHotkey as a workaround until the libraries are available.\r\n\r\n### Scripts Caching\r\n\r\nInstead of waiting for the main menu to parse/load the scripts, the previous scripts results are now cached. This shaves off the ~100ms delay when opening the main menu from the keyboard shortcut. (There are also some clever technical tricks under the hood that would require a blog post to explain)\r\n\r\n> Note: If you have a script that uses a shortcut which displays choices that don't change often, consider adding the `// Cache: true` metadata to the script for that extra 100ms boost.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Scripts Grouping and `groupChoices`\r\n\r\nUse the `//Group` metadata to group scripts together in the main menu. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Group: Favorite\r\n```\r\n\r\n![http://res.cloudinary.com/johnlindquist/image/upload/v1687909106/clipboard/bnsocw9vxhqafkmmyivv.png](http://res.cloudinary.com/johnlindquist/image/upload/v1687909106/clipboard/bnsocw9vxhqafkmmyivv.png)\r\n\r\nThe you can search for \"Favorite\" from the menu to filter to the scripts with that metadata.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also add the `.group` property to any choice, then pass your choices to `groupChoices` to use the grouping behavior in your own scripts.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Name: Group Choices\r\n// Cache: true\r\n\r\nimport \"@johnlindquist/kit\"\r\nimport { faker } from \"@faker-js/faker\"\r\nimport _ from \"lodash\"\r\n\r\nlet faang = [\"Facebook\", \"Apple\", \"Amazon\", \"Netflix\", \"Google\"]\r\n\r\nlet people = Array.from({ length: 25 }).map(() => {\r\n  let name = faker.person.fullName()\r\n  return {\r\n    name,\r\n    value: name,\r\n    description: faker.color.human(),\r\n    group: _.sample(faang), // Grouping by a random company\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n\r\nlet groupedChoices = groupChoices(people)\r\n\r\nlet result = await mini(\"Arg Group Demo\", groupedChoices)\r\nawait editor(result)\r\n```\r\n\r\n![http://res.cloudinary.com/johnlindquist/image/upload/v1687909060/clipboard/urzyst1cz3wd6olsk7lx.png](http://res.cloudinary.com/johnlindquist/image/upload/v1687909060/clipboard/urzyst1cz3wd6olsk7lx.png)\r\n\r\n### Flags \"Submenu\"\r\n\r\nWhen using `flags`, pressing \"right\" (or `cmd+k`) now displays the available actions (AKA \"flags\") to the side in a separate searchable list with its own state.\r\n\r\nThis is a first pass at a \"submenu\" feature. We'll explore nested submenus in the future.\r\n\r\n![http://res.cloudinary.com/johnlindquist/image/upload/v1687909291/clipboard/p7bwm9rxnhzquye3oxac.png](http://res.cloudinary.com/johnlindquist/image/upload/v1687909291/clipboard/p7bwm9rxnhzquye3oxac.png)\r\n\r\n### Searching Off-loaded to Main Process\r\n\r\nPreviously, the searching logic was done in the renderer process. This creating some technical limitations on how we could pass results from a script to the list.\r\n\r\nNow, you will be able pass \"scored\" choice results directly from the script to the list enabling you move the search logic to your script/server/API and display highlighted \"scored\" choices in the list. More information on this in the future.\r\n\r\n### `// Pass` and `.pass` Metadata\r\n\r\nThe `// Pass` metadata on a script (and `.pass` property on a choice) will pass the current input of the prompt directly to the script so you can type input from the main menu that will be passed to the script.\r\n\r\n![http://res.cloudinary.com/johnlindquist/image/upload/v1687909936/clipboard/p4bnehjxxkivrbderwhy.png](http://res.cloudinary.com/johnlindquist/image/upload/v1687909936/clipboard/p4bnehjxxkivrbderwhy.png)\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Name: Grocery List\r\n// Pass: true\r\n\r\nimport \"@johnlindquist/kit\"\r\n\r\nlet note = arg?.pass || (await arg(\"Enter an item\"))\r\n\r\nawait editor(note)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also do this with your own choices by using the `.pass` property on a choice and using the `groupChoices` (as discussed above) to bring up the more advanced list.\r\n\r\n### Choice `.miss` Property\r\n\r\nAdding `.miss` to a choice will make the choice only appear if the search doesn't match any other choices. This is useful for showing a \"No Results\" choice:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Name: Miss Demo\r\n\r\nimport \"@johnlindquist/kit\"\r\n\r\nawait mini(\"Select an Item\", [\r\n  \"One\",\r\n  \"Two\",\r\n  {\r\n    name: \"No Choices Available\",\r\n    miss: true,\r\n    disableSubmit: true,\r\n    nameClassName: `text-red-500`,\r\n  },\r\n])\r\n```\r\n\r\n![http://res.cloudinary.com/johnlindquist/image/upload/v1687910247/clipboard/s2dtq4wzty61sl3ig0ym.png](http://res.cloudinary.com/johnlindquist/image/upload/v1687910247/clipboard/s2dtq4wzty61sl3ig0ym.png)\r\n\r\n## Choice `.skip` Property\r\n\r\nUsing `.skip` allows you to create a choice that can't be searched/selected:\r\n\r\n> Note: This is used internally for the \"groupChoice()\" headers\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Name: Separator Demo\r\n\r\nimport \"@johnlindquist/kit\"\r\n\r\nawait arg(\"A demo for skip\", [\r\n  \"Apple\",\r\n  \"Banana\",\r\n  \"Cherry\",\r\n  {\r\n    name: \"Separator\",\r\n    height: PROMPT.ITEM.HEIGHT.XXXS,\r\n    html: `<div class=\"border-t border-gray-200 w-full\"></div>`,\r\n    skip: true,\r\n  },\r\n  \"Celery\",\r\n  \"Cucumber\",\r\n  \"Lettuce\",\r\n])\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Thanks for Using Script Kit!\r\n\r\nHappy Scripting!\r\n\r\n\\- John Lindquist","extension":".md","dir":"","file":"","description":"","tag":"","section":"","i":"","sectionIndex":"","createdAt":"2023-06-28T00:11:40Z"},{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36073?u=1617518acc4e480c94d57308adfedebcd936ffd1&v=4","user":"johnlindquist","author":"John Lindquist","twitter":null,"discussion":"https://github.com/johnlindquist/kit/discussions/1256","url":"","title":"Script Kit 1.59.1 - May 2023 Release","command":"script-kit-1591-may-2023-release","content":"# Script Kit 1.59.1 - May 2023 Release\r\n\r\n- Download from https://www.scriptkit.com/\r\n- Join our Discord: https://discord.gg/qnUX4XqJQd\r\n- Sponsor to Keep Script Kit Growing ❤️ (and unlock the debugger): [https://github.com/sponsors/johnlindquist/sponsorships?sponsor=johnlindquist](https://github.com/sponsors/johnlindquist/sponsorships?sponsor=johnlindquist&tier_id=235205)\r\n\r\n## Sunsetting Features\r\n\r\nWe're \"sunsetting\"/not supporting a few features going forward. \r\n\r\n> The `npm` and `db` apis will still be available (they're used internally in the SDK!), but we won't be actively supporting them\r\n\r\n1. `await npm()`. Use `await import()` or regular `import` statements instead.\r\n\r\nScript Kit now recommends using standard import methods. When you attempt to run a script and an import fails, Script Kit will catch the error and prompt you to install it. This removes the need for `await npm()`. This is especially useful for people using TypeScript as you don't need to worry about typing `npm` anymore.\r\n\r\n2. `await db()`. We now recommend `keyv`: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv)\r\n\r\n`keyv` is a much better solution for storing/retrieving data and achieves all of the future features we had planned for `db`.\r\n\r\nWe'll do our best to update older demos/tutorials that use these methods as we're able.\r\n\r\n## Previews Everywhere\r\n\r\nEvery prompt type (`term`, `drop`, `fields`, etc) now supports the `preview` key. Pass in HTML to display it to the right side of your prompt. This is great for instructions and guiding the user through each script:\r\n\r\n> Note: The `md()` helper is often used to transform markdown into HTML\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\nawait term({\r\n  preview: md(`# Follow these steps:\r\n\r\n1. First, type \\`ls\\` to see the files in this directory\r\n2. Then, type \\`cat <filename>\\` to see the contents of a file\r\n3. Finally, type \\`exit\\` to exit the terminal\r\n  `),\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"480\" alt=\"CleanShot 2023-05-15 at 11 54 22@2x\" src=\"https://github.com/johnlindquist/kit/assets/36073/fcabec36-4b03-4bd9-a7f6-3e2220d56ed5\">\r\n\r\n```js\r\nawait drop({\r\n  placeholder: \"Drop an mp3\",\r\n  preview: md(`# Convert mp3 to wav\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\n\r\n1.

In your `~/.kenv/.env` file, add:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nKIT_MONO_FONT=\"Menlo\"\r\nKIT_SANS_FONT=\"Arial\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Experimental: Shebang Scripts 🎉\r\n\r\nAdd a script in your `~/.kenv/scripts` directory with a shebang:\r\n\r\n![http://res.cloudinary.com/johnlindquist/image/upload/v1679779537/clipboard/v1oja8v05dgexdgtfjba.png](http://res.cloudinary.com/johnlindquist/image/upload/v1679779537/clipboard/v1oja8v05dgexdgtfjba.png)\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\nopen \"https://scriptkit.com\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run it from the main menu\r\n\r\n### Experimental: Windows `.bat` Files\r\n\r\nMac and Linux users have always had executables they could run in the terminal in the `~/.kenv/bin` dircetory. Now, on Windows, Script Kit will generate `.bat` files associated with each script that you can run from the terminal.\r\n\r\n### Info Choices\r\n\r\nWe now have a custom \"info\" choice that isn't selectable, but shows up in the list to present the user with additional information about the input/list:\r\n\r\n![http://res.cloudinary.com/johnlindquist/image/upload/v1679783784/clipboard/j4av6h2ybe1vezln2tt3.png](http://res.cloudinary.com/johnlindquist/image/upload/v1679783784/clipboard/j4av6h2ybe1vezln2tt3.png)\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Name: Testing Info OnNoChoices\r\n\r\nimport \"@johnlindquist/kit\"\r\n\r\nawait arg(\"Select a number\",\r\n  [\r\n    {\r\n      name: \"Sorry, no matches\",\r\n      info: \"onNoChoices\", // or \"always\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"one\",\r\n    \"two\",\r\n    \"three\",\r\n  ]\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Removing `npm` requirement\r\n\r\nWhen you run a script with a missing module, it will catch the error and prompt you to install it. This removes the requirement of the `await npm()`, but you can still use it if you find it more convenient.\r\n\r\nThe examples and scripts that I share from now on will no longer use `await npm()`, but I have no plans to deprecate it.\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\n- Lots of little improvements around the `chat` component.\r\n- Some solid performance improvements\r\n- Upgrading to lots of the latest libraries\r\n\r\n\r\n## Call for Help: Disable Window Animation on Windows?\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows how to disable the window animation on Windows (the one that transparently zooms in when you open a window), please let me know because I think it's super annoying and I'd love to disable it in the app. For now, I strongly recommend disabling it globally on Windows:\r\n\r\n1. Open the Settings app by pressing the Windows key + I.\r\n2. Click on “Ease of Access”.\r\n3. Scroll down to “Other options” and click on “Visual options”.\r\n4.

You can also use `shortcuts` the same way you would with other prompts.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Open chat-hello-world in Script Kit](https://scriptkit.com/api/new?name=chat-hello-world&url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/johnlindquist/609d3f2dcbc49911698c3c2162310c0d/raw/bfe67e1067554893647fa84ecd8277c00f848926/chat-hello-world.ts\")\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Name: Chat Hello World\r\n\r\nimport \"@johnlindquist/kit\"\r\n\r\nlet messages = await chat({\r\n  onSubmit: input => {\r\n    chat.addMessage(`You said, \"${input}\"`)\r\n  },\r\n})\r\n\r\ninspect(messages)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `kit-examples` repo (bundled with new installs) has an example of using the latest ChatGPT model:\r\nhttps://github.com/johnlindquist/kit-examples/blob/main/scripts/chatgpt.js\r\n\r\n✨ Want more AI example scripts? Check out this post 👀: https://github.com/johnlindquist/kit/discussions/1143 ✨\r\n\r\n### The `eyeDropper` Color Picker\r\n\r\nYou can now use the `eyeDropper` function to pick a color from anywhere on your screen. It returns an object with `sRGBHex` to align with Chrome's Eyedropper tool.\r\n\r\n> Note: Unfortunately, windows restricts color picking to the foreground window. Still investigating a workaround.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Open testing-get-color in Script Kit](https://scriptkit.com/api/new?name=testing-get-color&url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/johnlindquist/e10cc5dfc08fd5c9824bb3a7e5e50071/raw/76bb4b86f08e1f2a8b2f09d6e2ba47286dc42673/testing-get-color.ts\")\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Name: Testing Get Color\r\n\r\nimport \"@johnlindquist/kit\"\r\n\r\nawait hide()\r\nlet value = await eyeDropper()\r\nawait editor(value.sRGBHex)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Node 18.12.1\r\n\r\nScript Kit now bundles Node 18.12.1. (Previous scripts ran on Node 16.17.2).\r\n\r\n### New Settings in `~/.kit/db/app.json` Features\r\n\r\n- \"mini\" boolean - Use Script Kit in a much smaller window\r\n- \"termFont\" string - Set the font for the terminal\r\n- \"cachePrompt\" boolean - If you experience issues with the prompt position caching logic, disable it so is _always_ show in the center of the screen\r\n- \"convertKeymap\" boolean - Script Kit auto converts to your selected OS keymap (dvorak, colemak, etc). There have been a few reports of this conflicting with Portuguese keyboards. If you experience issues, disable this setting.\r\n- \"searchDebounce\" boolean - by default, Script Kit will debounce when your choices list has over >1000 items. It's mostly a precaution and you can disable it if you'd like.\r\n\r\nThe defaults are as follows:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"mini\": false,\r\n    \"termFont\": \"monospace\",\r\n    \"cachePrompt\": true,\r\n    \"convertKeymap\": true,\r\n    \"searchDebounce\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed a bug where `theme` was reset to the default when waking from sleep\r\n- Fixed the `Open in Script Kit` urls for Windows users\r\n- Fixed Calculator sizing from main menu\r\n- `await npm(\"package-name\")`  will now mark a package as an \"external\" dependency in TypeScript so you can use import statements for packages that aren't installed yet and your script will still compile\r\n- Other minor bug fixes\r\n- Fixed installation issues when dealing with certs/proxies\r\n\r\n## Experimental\r\n\r\n### `toast()`\r\n\r\nYou can try out the experimental `toast(\"Copied\")` feature. I'm still working out the API, so there's no \"onClick\" or anything, but you should be able to pass the other toast properties (this uses `react-toastify`) explained [here](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/dispatch-toast-outside-of-react-component)","extension":".md","dir":"","file":"","description":"","tag":"","section":"","i":"","sectionIndex":"","createdAt":"2023-03-03T19:33:27Z"},{"name":"Chat Hello World","note":"This lib is updated fairly frequently to keep up with Google's changes: https://www.npmjs.com/package/googlethis","todo":"I'm sure this can be _vastly_ improved","avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36073?u=1617518acc4e480c94d57308adfedebcd936ffd1&v=4","user":"johnlindquist","author":"John Lindquist","twitter":null,"discussion":"https://github.com/johnlindquist/kit/discussions/1143","url":"","title":"Script Kit AI Chat Pre-release","command":"script-kit-ai-chat-pre-release","content":"\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36073/221332902-87c2d0a4-46b8-4eb1-a935-9a9fcae90e94.mp4\r\n\r\n## This is a Preview Build for Next Week's Release\r\n\r\nI'm releasing this to gather some feedback about the Chat component before I push the main release in the beginning of March.

The theming was completely re-written to help build out customs themes, so we took the opportunity to clean up the main theme.\r\n\r\nYou may also notice subtle differences in app shadows, transparency, etc which are thanks to the latest Electron updates supporting \"Panel\" windows (which we were accomplishing through third-party, less-than-ideal ways before). Speaking of updates...\r\n\r\n## Updated to the Latest Versions\r\n\r\nScript Kit is now on the latest Electron 22, node 16.17.1, and many of the internal dependencies how been updated as well. If you're a developer, you know how big of an undertaking this can be (and how refreshing it is when you're done).\r\n\r\nElectron 22 is an exciting release from a dev standpoint and we can't wait to dig into using some of the new features.\r\n\r\n## Alternate Keymap Support\r\n\r\nScript Kit shortcuts will now support your custom/international keymaps. If will also detect if a keymap has changed and remap based on the new configuration\r\n\r\n> Note: If you have a shortcut that accounted for the keymap being \"wrong\", you'll need to update it to the correct version\r\n\r\n## Run a Script From Other Apps with ~/.kit/run.txt\r\n\r\nIf you want to launch Script Kit from the terminal or another app, write the command and arguments to the `~/.kit/run.txt` file. \r\nScript Kit watches for changes and will run the command you write to the file.\r\n\r\nThe following will run the script `browse-scriptkit.js` in your ~/.kenv/scripts dir:\r\n\r\nMac:\r\n```bash\r\necho browse-scriptkit > ~/.kit/run.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nWindows:\r\n```cmd\r\necho browse-scriptkit > %HOMEPATH%\\.kit\\run.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Note: You can still use ~/.kit/kar, but I wanted to offer an alternative to our Windows friends\r\n\r\n## Watchers Menu\r\n\r\n> 🚨 Note: It's now required to manually start the snippet/clipboard watcher from the menubar icon->Watchers menu.\r\n\r\n Some users reported difficulty/freezing with the keyboard monitoring for snippets due to various other app conflicts, hardware conflicts, etc, so we decided to allow more control over starting/stopping/waking the watcher in case something happens. We worked hard in this release to address these issues, but decided it's still best to give control to the user.\r\n\r\n## Windows setSelectedText() Fixed\r\n\r\nWindows will now properly hide the prompt to be able to paste text to the app behind it\r\n\r\n## Soon... Scripts on GitHub Actions\r\n\r\nMade significant progress towards using Script Kit on GitHub Actions. Need some more time to test and handle edge cases, but we're close!!!","extension":".md","dir":"","file":"","description":"","tag":"","section":"","i":"","sectionIndex":"","createdAt":"2022-12-08T02:29:43Z"},{"enter":"Rotate Images","avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36073?u=1617518acc4e480c94d57308adfedebcd936ffd1&v=4","user":"johnlindquist","author":"John Lindquist","twitter":null,"discussion":"https://github.com/johnlindquist/kit/discussions/949","url":"","title":"Script Kit v1.36.0 November 2022 Release","command":"script-kit-v1360-november-2022-release","content":"# Script Kit v1.36.0 November 2022 Release\r\n\r\nDownload from [https://www.scriptkit.com/](https://www.scriptkit.com/)\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAXPa1Jxcvg\"><img src=\"https://yt-embed.herokuapp.com/embed?v=bAXPa1Jxcvg\" alt=\"Script Kit November Release Video\"></a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Script Markdown\r\n\r\nPlace a multiline comment at the top of your script to display Markdown to the user when previewing the script. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/*\r\n# Rotate Images\r\n- Get the selected image from Finder\r\n- Creates 3 new versions rotated at 90, 180, and 270\r\n*/\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Script `Enter` Metadata\r\n\r\nAdding `Enter` metadata will now change the text displayed by the \"Run\" button in the script preview.

This build is very close to feature-parity with the OSX version, so you can expect the vast majority of scripts you run on Mac to also run on Windows.\r\n\r\n> Note: We haven't purchased the Windows code signing certificate yet, so Windows will warn you that it can't verify Script Kit when you begin the install process. Also, this causes that Windows updates will need to be installed manually. We plan on setting up the Windows code-signing certificate by the end of the year to fix these issues then we'll remove the \"Preview\" label 😊\r\n\r\nSnippets, Watchers, Schedule, etc, etc, etc all work. If an api is not supported on Windows (mostly the functions that get information about the desktop) then it will display a \"Not supported on Windows\" message.\r\n\r\nThe \"Browse\" (`/` from the main menu) and \"File Search\" (`.` from the main menu) both required a ton of work, but they're working as well. We'll get the App Launcher sorted out in the next release.\r\n\r\n## Debugger\r\n\r\nYou can now debug your scripts by simply pressing `cmd+enter` from the main menu (`ctrl+enter` on Windows). This will open a built-in inspector that will allow you to step through your script, set breakpoints, and inspect variables.\r\n\r\nUse the `debugger` keyword to set a breakpoint in your script. The inspector will pause execution when it hits the breakpoint and you can mess around with the variables and step through the script to your heart's content. You can even invoke functions such as `setDescription()` and treat the inspector like a REPL.\r\n\r\n## Repair\r\n\r\nThe menubar now includes a `Debug` menu. From `Debug->Force Repair Kit SDK` you can force the Kit SDK to be reinstalled. This is useful if you're having issues with the Kit SDK due to npm acting up or if an update failed.\r\n\r\n## `await cutText()`\r\n\r\nThe `cutText()` function will cut the latest typed word and bring it into your script.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet word = await cutText()\r\n\r\n// Send word to an API, wrap the word in markdown, etc, etc\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Other Fixes\r\n\r\n* The TypeScript esbuild compiling should be faster and more stable\r\n* New install splash now shows the npm progress status\r\n* App Launcher fixes (`;` from the main menu)\r\n* Google Fixes (`~` from the main menu)","extension":".md","dir":"","file":"","description":"","tag":"","section":"","i":"","sectionIndex":"","createdAt":"2022-10-27T16:08:15Z"},{"name":"Example Postfix Snippet","snippet":"*html,,","avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36073?u=1617518acc4e480c94d57308adfedebcd936ffd1&v=4","user":"johnlindquist","author":"John Lindquist","twitter":null,"discussion":"https://github.com/johnlindquist/kit/discussions/901","url":"","title":"September 2022 Release (version 1.30.8) - Postfix Snippets, UI Shortcuts, VS Code Extension, and Much, much more!","command":"september-2022-release-version-1308-postfix-snippets-ui-shortcuts-vs-code-extension-and-much-much-more","content":"# Script Kit 1.30.8 Released 🎉\r\n\r\nDownload here: https://www.scriptkit.com/\r\n\r\nThis is our first release after a couple of busy summer months, and it's slam-packed full of new features and UX!\r\n\r\n## Postfix Snippets\r\n\r\nPostfix snippets are snippets that are triggered by typing a postfix after a \"variable\" of text. The variable is represented by a `*` at the beginning of snippet. In the `*html,,` example below, typing `divhtml,,` would treat `div` as the variable and render out `<div>Hello world</div>`.\r\n\r\n### Postfix Snippet Hello World\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Name: Example Postfix Snippet\r\n// Snippet: *html,,\r\n\r\nimport \"@johnlindquist/kit\"\r\n\r\nlet value = await arg(\"I'm the '*' content\")\r\n\r\nsetSelectedText(`<${value}>Hello world</${value}>`)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Postfix Snippet Query API\r\n\r\nThe snippet can also take the content of the `*` and post it to an API for more complex scripts.\r\n\r\nIn this example, the content is used to query google and create a markdown link from the word you typed.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Name: Markdown Link from Google Snippet\r\n// Snippet: *,.\r\n\r\nimport \"@johnlindquist/kit\"\r\n\r\nlet google  = await npm(\"googlethis\")\r\n\r\nconst options = {\r\n  page: 0, \r\n  safe: false,\r\n  additional_params: { \r\n    hl: 'en' \r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet value = await arg(\"I'm the asterisk content\")\r\nlet response = await google.search(value, options);\r\n\r\nlet url = response.results[0].url\r\n\r\nsetSelectedText(`[${value}](${url})`)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## `template()`\r\n\r\nThe `template` prompt will present the editor populated by your template. You can then tab through each variable in your template and edit it. \r\n\r\nTemplates pair really, _really_ nicely with Snippets!\r\n\r\n### Template Hello World\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet text = await template(`Hello $1!`)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Standard Usage\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet text = await template(`\r\nDear \\${1:name},\r\n\r\nPlease meet me at \\${2:address}\r\n\r\n    Sincerely, John`)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## `await docs()`\r\n\r\n`docs()` takes the file path of a markdown file and displays it as a list of choices.\r\n\r\nEach h2 is displayed as a choice while the content of the h2 is displayed in the preview.\r\n\r\nSelected the choice will return current h2.\r\n\r\n### Submitting a `docs()` value\r\n\r\nIf you'd rather submit a value instead of the h2, then use an HTML comment to specify the value under the h2's content:\r\n\r\n```md\r\n## I'm the Choice Header\r\n<!-- value: This will be returned -->\r\n```\r\n\r\n### `docs()` Example\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Name: Example Docs\r\n\r\nimport \"@johnlindquist/kit\"\r\n\r\nlet buffer = await download(`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BuilderIO/qwik/main/README.md`)\r\n\r\nlet filePath = tmpPath(\"README.md\")\r\nawait writeFile(filePath, buffer)\r\n\r\n\r\nlet selectedDoc = await docs(filePath)\r\n\r\ndev({selectedDoc})\r\n```\r\n\r\n## UI Shortcuts in the \"Action Bar\"\r\n\r\nThe September 2022 release adds a new \"Action Bar\" at the bottom of the UI which supports custom shortcuts.\r\n\r\nA shortcut has a `name`, `key`, `onPress` and `bar` property. When you press the shortcut, it will trigger the `onPress` function. You can also click on the shortcut to trigger the `onPress` function.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet clearInput = {\r\n            name: \"Clear\",\r\n            key: \"cmd+u\",            \r\n            onPress: async () => { \r\n                setInput(\"\")\r\n            },\r\n            // optional, but will only display when set\r\n            bar: \"right\",\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd each shortcuts to a `shortcuts` array which is passed to the prompt config (most commonly, the first argument of `arg()`).\r\n\r\n### UI Shortcuts Example\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Name: Shortcuts Example\r\n\r\nimport \"@johnlindquist/kit\"\r\n\r\nlet clearInput = {\r\n            name: \"Clear\",\r\n            key: \"cmd+u\",            \r\n            onPress: async () => { \r\n                setInput(\"\")\r\n            },\r\n            // optional, but will only display when set\r\n            bar: \"right\",\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet reloadChoices = {\r\n            name: \"Reload\",\r\n            key: \"cmd+l\",\r\n            bar: \"right\",\r\n            onPress: async () => { \r\n                setChoices([\"one\",\"two\",\"three\"])\r\n            }\r\n}      \r\n\r\nlet submitInputNotChoice = {\r\n            name: \"Submit Input\",\r\n            key: \"cmd+i\",\r\n            bar: \"right\",\r\n            onPress: async (input) => { \r\n                submit(input)\r\n            }\r\n}                \r\n\r\nlet runAppLauncher = {\r\n            name: \"Launch App\",\r\n            key: \"cmd+a\",\r\n            bar: \"left\",\r\n            onPress: async () => { \r\n                await run(kitPath(\"main\", \"app-launcher.js\"))\r\n            }\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet result = await arg({\r\n    placeholder: \"Shortcut demo\",\r\n    shortcuts: [        \r\n        clearInput,\r\n        reloadChoices,\r\n        submitInputNotChoice,\r\n        runAppLauncher\r\n    ]\r\n}, [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"])\r\n\r\nawait div(md(`## ${result}`))\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Recent Script Moved to Top\r\n\r\nThe most recently run script is now moved to the top of the list so that the next time you open the main prompt, you can quickly run it again.\r\n\r\n\r\n## VS Code Extension\r\n\r\nWe now have a VS Code extension which allows you to run scripts directly from VS Code:\r\n\r\nhttps://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnlindquist.kit-extension\r\n\r\nMore features are coming soon!\r\n\r\n## Menubar Updates\r\n\r\nThe menubar menu now has a \"Dev Tools\" menu which allows you to perform some common commands that might not be obvious from the main UI.\r\n\r\nThe menu also lists all of the running processes so that you can easily terminate them without having to hunt around from process ids.\r\n\r\n## cmd+tab to Widgets and `dev`\r\n\r\nWhen the main prompt is open, a widget is open, or a `dev` window is open, the Script Kit icon will be added to the doc to allow you to cmd+tab back to widgets/editor/dev/etc. Since Script Kit is a combination of a temporary prompt (like Alfred) but also can host long-running widgets, we had to work through various scenarios of when cmd+tab can be available. Hopefully we've landed on a solution that works for everyone.\r\n\r\n## Main Menu `API` and `Guide`\r\n\r\nThe Main Menu of Script Kit now hosts `API` and `Guide` tabs which allow you to easily copy code snippets or create new scripts from the examples. They're also both easy to update, so you can expect more samples and explanations to play with in the future!\r\n\r\n## `await emoji()`\r\n\r\nA brand new emoji picker\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet e = await emoji()\r\nsetSelectedText(e.emoji)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## `await fields()`\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet [first, last] = await fields([\"First name\", \"Last name\"])\r\n\r\ndev({\r\n    first,\r\n    last\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n## `beep()`\r\n\r\nAnd the most exciting announcement of all, `beep()` is now available!\r\n\r\n`beep()` plays a beep sound.\r\n\r\n### `beep()` Example\r\n\r\n```js\r\nbeep()\r\n```\r\n\r\n","extension":".md","dir":"","file":"","description":"","tag":"","section":"","i":"","sectionIndex":"","createdAt":"2022-09-29T08:49:36Z"},{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36073?u=1617518acc4e480c94d57308adfedebcd936ffd1&v=4","user":"johnlindquist","author":"John Lindquist","twitter":null,"discussion":"https://github.com/johnlindquist/kit/discussions/787","url":"","title":"June 2022 Release (version 1.19.3) - Menu, Native Keyboard, ignoreBlur","command":"june-2022-release-version-1193-menu-native-keyboard-ignoreblur","content":"# Script Kit 1.19.3 Released 🎉\r\n\r\nDownload here: https://www.scriptkit.com/\r\nDirect downloads:\r\n* Intel: https://github.com/johnlindquist/kitapp/releases/download/v1.19.3/Kit-1.19.3.dmg\r\n* m1: https://github.com/johnlindquist/kitapp/releases/download/v1.19.3/Kit-1.19.3-arm64.dmg\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Moved all notifications to menu colored “dots” (red, orange, green)\r\n    * In the future, the user will be able to set these notifications as well\r\n* Completely re-vamped menu for common options\r\n* Implemented an “auth helpers” when user does actions that require “accessibility permissions” (Snippets, clipboard history, setSelectedText, etc)\r\n* `ignoreBlur` allows window to go behind other windows and stay open\r\n* `node` is now stored in `~/.knode` (instead of ~/.kit/node) to allow npx to work in the terminal\r\n* `node` version set to v16.14.2.

So now Script KIt comes with a pre-configured editor, complete with autocompletion and error checking:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36073/152349718-9f9af13f-4cbb-4444-810a-2f1281938106.mp4\r\n\r\nIf you're already using vs code, you can switch to the \"Kit\" editor in the `Kit` tab -> `Change Editor`.\r\n\r\n## Main Menu Shortcuts and `/`, `~`, and `>`\r\n\r\nThe Script Kit main menu will continue to grow in features. \r\n\r\n### Shortcuts\r\n\r\n* `cmd+f` - Does a `grep` search through all of your scripts\r\n* `cmd+p` - Launches a `Processes` menu for currently running scripts\r\n\r\n### Path Mode\r\nType the following characters to change the mode of the main menu:\r\n* <kbd>~</kbd> Switches to a path selector mode in your home directory\r\n* <kbd>/</kbd> Switches to a path selector mode in your root directory\r\n\r\nNavigate with <kbd>right</kbd>/<kbd>left</kbd> or <kbd>tab</kbd>/<kbd>shift+tab</kbd> then select with <kbd>return</kbd>. Here's an example of typing `~`\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36073/152386816-8be054d6-047c-416f-ae2b-dce1723d222c.mp4\r\n\r\n### Command Mode\r\n\r\n* <kbd>></kbd> Switches to a command mode to execute a command\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36073/152387376-b2e8b71a-4980-4d23-8c98-4f56f3ce1fdd.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n### Future Work\r\nIn the March release, planning on these:\r\n\r\n* <kbd>,</kbd> List system preferences\r\n* <kbd>.</kbd> App launcher\r\n* <kbd>;</kbd> MEGA MENU WITH EVERYTHING 🤭\r\n\r\n## `await path()`\r\n\r\nYou can now prompt to select a path. This UI  works exactly like \"path mode\" above.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet selectedPath = await path()\r\ncd(selectedPath)\r\n\r\nawait exec(`git pull`) // this will now operate based on the selectedPath\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Event Handlers\r\n\r\nWhen building the `path` prompt, I realized it just wasn't possible to do in a script. So I put in the effort to expose the event handlers from the app into the prompt. So even though `path` behaves very differently, it's still an `arg` with customized handlers. You can override many of the handlers yourself for customized prompts:\r\n\r\nFor example, you can override the default behavior of `Escape` terminating your current script:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Submit the current input when you hit escape\r\nawait arg({\r\n  onEscape: (input)=> {\r\n    submit(input)\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nOverriding handlers is definitely considered \"advanced\", so I'm happy to answer any questions!\r\n\r\nHere's a list of all the new `arg` config properties:\r\n```js\r\nexport interface ChannelHandler {\r\n  (input: string, state: AppState): void | Promise<void>\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport interface PromptConfig\r\n  onNoChoices?: ChannelHandler\r\n  onChoices?: ChannelHandler\r\n  onEscape?: ChannelHandler\r\n  onAbandon?: ChannelHandler\r\n  onBack?: ChannelHandler\r\n  onForward?: ChannelHandler\r\n  onUp?: ChannelHandler\r\n  onDown?: ChannelHandler\r\n  onLeft?: ChannelHandler\r\n  onRight?: ChannelHandler\r\n  onTab?: ChannelHandler\r\n  onInput?: ChannelHandler\r\n  onBlur?: ChannelHandler\r\n  onChoiceFocus?: ChannelHandler\r\n\r\n  debounceInput?: number\r\n  debounceChoiceFocus?: number\r\n\r\n  onInputSubmit?: {\r\n    [key: string]: any\r\n  }\r\n  onShortcutSubmit?: {\r\n    [key: string]: any\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## onInputSubmit, onShortcutSubmit\r\n\r\nIf you want to create \"shortcuts\" to submit specific values, can use the new `onInputSubmit` and `onShortcutSubmit`. These allow you to bind text or shortcuts to submit values. This is exactly how the main menu works:\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2022-02-03 at 09 47 42](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36073/152388672-db242f4e-20e2-4645-a326-a8bbc960f63d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Beta Pro Features: Menubar\r\n\r\nYou can now customize the text of the Script Kit menubar icon to say anything with the `pro.beta.menubar` method. In the future, you'll be able to build out an entire menu, but I thought I'd sneak this feature in for fun in this build:\r\n\r\n[Open menubar-demo in Script Kit](https://scriptkit.com/api/new?name=menubar-demo&url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/johnlindquist/ef01308eb63715970f26ee1378473194/raw/9ad4219968d9ec1a9747811a71c678ad8e241ec0/menubar-demo.ts\")\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Name: Menubar Demo\r\n\r\nimport \"@johnlindquist/kit\"\r\n\r\nlet value = await arg(\"Set the menubar to:\")\r\npro.beta.menubar(value)\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36073/152394319-d9e071fe-edcd-4cf2-be3e-60d5ba7b01cd.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n## Terminate Processes\r\n\r\nIf you need to end a script that's running in the background, stuck on an exec command, or whatever reason, open the main menu with the <kbd>cmd+;</kbd> shortcut, then press this button (or hit <kbd>cmd+p</kbd>.

But, how?\r\n\r\nEach time your run a TS script, Script Kit will compile the TS script using `esbuild` to a JS script in a `.scripts` dir (notice the \"dot\"). The compiled JS script is then imported from there. Using `.scripts` as a sibling dir will help avoid any `import`/path issues. You can also write TS \"library\" files in your `~/.kenv/lib` dir and import them into your script just fine.\r\n\r\nIf you're experienced with `esbuild` and curious about the settings, they look like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet { build } = await import(\"esbuild\")\r\n\r\nawait build({\r\n  entryPoints: [scriptPath],\r\n  outfile,\r\n  bundle: true,\r\n  platform: \"node\",\r\n  format: \"esm\",\r\n  external: [\"@johnlindquist/kit\"],\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis also opens the door to exporting/building/bundling scripts and libs as individual shippable tools which I'll investigate more in the future.\r\n\r\n### 2. Can I still run my JS scripts if I switch to TS?\r\n\r\nYes! Both your TS and JS scripts will show up in the UI.\r\n\r\n### 3. Why the `import \"@johnlindquist/kit\"`?\r\n\r\nWhen you create a new TS script, the generated script will start with the line: `import \"@johnlindquist/kit\"`\r\n\r\nThis is mostly to make your editor stop complaining by forcing it to load the type definition files and forcing it to treat the file as an \"es module\" so support \"top-level `await`\". It's not technically required since it's not technically importing anything, but your editor will certainly complain very loudly if you leave it out.\r\n\r\n### 4. Where is the setting stored?\r\n\r\nLook in your `~/.kenv/.env` for `KIT_MODE=ts`.\r\n\r\n## fs-extra's added to global\r\n\r\nThe [fs-extra methods](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-extra#methods) are now added on the global space. I found myself using `outputFile`, `write/readJson`, etc too often and found them to be a great addition. The only one missing is `copy` since we're already using that to \"copy to clipboard\". You can bring it in with the normal import/alias process if needed, e.g., `let {copy:fsCopy} = await import(\"fs-extra\")`\r\n\r\n## Sync Path\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2021-09-27 at 11 10 26](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36073/134954703-7c9d779f-268a-4f8b-973a-59ac71eebaf0.png)\r\n\r\nYou may notice running scripts from the Script Kit app that some commands you can run in your terminal might be missing, like \"yarn\", etc.\r\n\r\nRun the following command in your terminal to copy the $PATH var from your terminal to your `~/.kenv/.env`. This will help \"sync\" up which commands are available between your terminal and running scripts from the app.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n~/.kit/bin/kit sync-path\r\n```\r\n","extension":".md","dir":"","file":"","description":"","tag":"","section":"","i":"","sectionIndex":"","createdAt":"2021-09-27T17:25:03Z"},{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36073?u=1617518acc4e480c94d57308adfedebcd936ffd1&v=4","user":"johnlindquist","author":"John Lindquist","twitter":null,"discussion":"https://github.com/johnlindquist/kit/discussions/442","url":"","title":"Scripts in GitHub actions (preview)","command":"scripts-in-github-actions-preview","content":"## tl;dr Here's an example repo\r\n\r\nThe example script creates a release, downloads an image, and uploads it to the release.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/johnlindquist/kit-action-example\r\n\r\n## Template Repo\r\n\r\nThis page has a \"one-click\" clone so you can add/play with your own script.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/johnlindquist/kit-action-template\r\n\r\n## What is it?\r\n\r\nUse any of your scripts in a GitHub action. `use` the `kit-action` and point it to a scripts in your `scripts` dir:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\nname: \"example\"\r\non:\r\n  workflow_dispatch:\r\n  pull_request:\r\n  push:\r\n    branches:\r\n      - main\r\n\r\njobs:\r\n  example:\r\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\r\n    steps:\r\n      - name: Script Kit\r\n        uses: johnlindquist/kit-action@main\r\n        with:\r\n          script: \"example-script\" # The name of a script in your ./scripts dir\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Add env vars:\r\n\r\nYou most likely add [\"secrets\" to GitHub actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-an-environment), so you'll want to pass them to your scripts as environment variables:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\njobs:\r\n  example:\r\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\r\n    steps:\r\n      - name: Script Kit\r\n        uses: johnlindquist/kit-action@main\r\n        with:\r\n          script: \"example-script\"\r\n        env:\r\n          REPO_TOKEN: \"${{ secrets.REPO_TOKEN }}\" # load in your script with await env(\"REPO_TOKEN\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Works with your existing repos\r\n\r\nFeel free to add this action and a `scripts` dir to your existing repos.

This is to help keep it consistent with terminal usage:\r\n\r\nFrom the terminal\r\n```bash\r\nflags-demo --open\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill set the global `flag.open` to `true`\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2021-08-13 at 10 08 30](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36073/129388037-3f27a12d-9e44-4402-a51f-bac39eead54d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nYou could also run this and pass in all the args:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nflags-demo https://egghead.io --copy\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the app, you could create a second script to pass flags to the first with. This is required if you need to pass multiple flags since the `arg` helper can only \"submit\" one per `arg`.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nawait run(`flags-demo https://egghead.io --copy`)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll put together some more demos soon. There are plenty of existing CLI tools out there using flags heavily, so lots of inspiration to pull from.\r\n\r\n## `await div()`\r\n\r\nThere's a new `div` \"component\". You can pass in arbitrary HTML. This works well with the `md()` helper which generates `html` from markdown.\r\n\r\n[Install div-demo](https://scriptkit.com/api/new?name=div-demo&url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/johnlindquist/0ad790953f7101d313abfd48182356b0/raw/c70e17649317986707d2ac714c31afe6f7850015/div-demo.js)\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Menu: Div Demo\r\n\r\n// Hit \"enter\" to continue, escape to exit\r\nawait div(`<img src=\"https://placekitten.com/320\"/>`)\r\n\r\nawait div(\r\n  md(\r\n    `\r\n    # Some header\r\n\r\n    ## You guessed it, an h2\r\n\r\n    * I\r\n    * love\r\n    * lists\r\n    `\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Fixed `notify`\r\n\r\n`notify` is now fixed so that it doesn't open a prompt\r\n\r\nThe most basic usage is:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nnotify(\"Hello world\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n`notify` leverages [https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-notifier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-notifier)\r\n\r\nSo the entire API should be available.

Download https://www.scriptkit.com/\r\n2. Quit Kit. *note - typing `kit quit` or `k q` in the app is the fastest way to quit.\r\n3. Drag/drop to overwrite your previous build\r\n4. Kit should now auto-update from the M1 channel\r\n5. Open Kit\r\n\r\n## Kenv Management\r\nThere are a lot of tools to help manage other kenvs. They're in the `Kit` menu and once you've installed a remote kenv (which is really just a git repo with a scripts dir), then more options show up in the `Edit` menu to move scripts between kenvs, etc. I'll cover this in detail in the docs/lessons\r\n\r\n## Polish\r\nLots of UI work:\r\n* Remembering position - Each script with a `//Shortcut` will remember its last individual prompt position. For example, if you have a script that uses `textarea`, then drag it to the upper right, the next time you launch that script, it will launch in that position.\r\n* `//Image` metadata - Scripts can now have images:\r\n```js\r\n//Image: https://placekitten.com/64\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```js\r\n//Image: logo.png\r\n```\r\nwill load from `~/.kenv/assets/logo.png`\r\n\r\n\r\n* Spinner - added a spinner for when you submit a prompt and the process needs to do some work before opening the next prompt\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2021-07-16 at 12 22 58](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36073/125992326-7b6f0034-00e8-41df-9ca7-f0e33becf0b2.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Resizing - *Lots* of work on getting window resizing behavior consistent between different UIs. This was a huge pain, but you'll probably never appreciate it 😅\r\n* Lots more - many more small things\r\n\r\n## Lessons!\r\n\r\nI'm starting to work on lessons next week and getting back into streaming schedule.

It should all work fine, but will be _waaaay_ cooler in the future 😎\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2021-06-04 at 11 50 32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36073/120843227-16b29500-c52b-11eb-974c-a81c260b9ae2.png)\r\n\r\n## Improved Error Prompt\r\n\r\nNow when an error occurs, it takes the error data, shuts down the script, then prompts you on what to do. For example, trying to use the old `db` would result in this:\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2021-06-04 at 12 03 04](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36073/120844575-d6541680-c52c-11eb-8d12-c7c3117e132e.png)\r\n\r\n## Improved Tab Switching\r\nSwitching tabs will now cancel the previous tabs' script. Previously, if you quickly switched tabs on the main menu, the \"Hot\" tab results might show up in a different tab because the loaded _after_ the tab switched. The internals around message passing between the script and the app now have a cancellation mechanism so you only get the latest result that matches the prompt/tab.
