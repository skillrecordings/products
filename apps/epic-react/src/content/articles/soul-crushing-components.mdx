React components afford us the opportunity to encapsulate state, logic, and
markup in a single place. A component is like a magical machine where you
pass in props and a beautiful component pops out the other end.

Unfortunately, truly maintainable, flexible, simple, and reusable components
require more thought than: "I need it to do this differently, so I'll accept a
new prop for that." Seasoned React developers know this leads to nothing but
pain and frustration for both the maintainer and user of the component. Ever
hear of

It's not fun.

The only thing you can really expect about the future is the unexpected. Nobody
can know the future for certain, so you need some tools in your toolbelt that
help you avoid committing yourself to a path that may not satisfy the needs of
the future. With React components, these tools are patterns that have been
battle tested in real applications and libraries and if you're not using them in
your components today, you're likely dealing with APIs that result in more
workarounds than lines of maintainable code.

And that's slowing you down.

## For example

One of my favorite tools for creating great component abstractions is the idea
of "compound components." The idea of compound components has been around
forever (think `<select>` and `<option>`), and it's been implemented in some of
my favorite libraries (check [Reach UI](https://reach.tech/)). Utilizing
compound components, you can go from an inflexible API like this:

```jsx
<Modal
  modalTitle="Register"
  modalLabelText="Registration form"
  openButtonText="Register"
  dismissable={true}
  contents={
    <LoginForm
      onSubmit={register}
      submitButton={<Button variant="secondary">Register</Button>}
    />
  }
/>
```

To something with ultimate flexibility like this:

```jsx
<Modal>
  <ModalOpenButton>
    <Button variant="secondary">Register</Button>
  </ModalOpenButton>
  <ModalContents aria-label="Registration form">
    <ModalDismissButton>
      <CircleButton>
        <VisuallyHidden>Close</VisuallyHidden>
        <span aria-hidden>√ó</span>
      </CircleButton>
    </ModalDismissButton>
    <ModalTitle>Register</ModalTitle>
    <LoginForm
      onSubmit={register}
      submitButton={<Button variant="secondary">Register</Button>}
    />
  </ModalContents>
</Modal>
```

(Note, the compound components are all the ones that start with `Modal`).

I can tell some of you are looking at this thinking: "Huh... well I actually
like the first one better." But remember, we can't anticipate all the needs of
our component's API in the future, so we want to focus on which will be most
adaptable.

Consider the difficulty in the following possible future use cases:

- We want to add a "cancel" button (but still need to support the dismiss
  button)
- We want to style the modal title, open button, or dismiss button (you want to
  add a `openButtonProps` prop? lol, I wish I could say I've never tried that
  before ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

Oh, and the neat thing about this is that if you really _do_ like the first one
better, there's nothing stopping you from creating a component that uses the
compound components API to expose the same API as the first. But try doing that
in the reverse üòâ

Taking things further, if it's really common enough, you could create a special
`ModalContents` component that handles rendering the dismiss button and title,
so in the end it looks like:

```jsx
<Modal>
  <ModalOpenButton>
    <Button variant="secondary">Register</Button>
  </ModalOpenButton>
  <ModalContents aria-label="Registration form" title="Register">
    <LoginForm
      onSubmit={register}
      submitButton={<Button variant="secondary">Register</Button>}
    />
  </ModalContents>
</Modal>
```

But you don't have to sacrifice the benefits of the previous API thanks to
composition. Sure you could do something similar with our previous API, but have
you ever tried to maintain a component with a hodgepodge of props like that? I
mean, I love that React components can be black boxes just as much as the next
developer, but I'd prefer to not experience soul-crushing maintainability
nightmares any time I need to venture into that black box...

## Conclusion

The beauty of patterns like compound components, state reducers, prop getters,
controlled props, etc. is that you can have your simple API _and_ a simple
implementation at the same time. If you aren't doing this yet, **now's a great
time to start.**

And I'm excited to teach you how on [EpicReact.Dev](https://epicreact.dev).
