  If you use a ref in your effect callback, shouldn't it be included in the
  dependencies? Why refs are a special exception to the rule!

Let's say we've got a form that allows you to specify a username. When you try
to submit an invalid value, it will show an error message and refocus on the
input so you can fix your mistake.

```tsx
import * as React from 'react'

function UsernameForm({
  initialUsername = '',
  onSubmitUsername,
}: {
  initialUsername?: string
  onSubmitUsername: (username: string) => void
}) {
  const [username, setUsername] = React.useState(initialUsername)
  const [touched, setTouched] = React.useState(false)

  const usernameInputRef = React.useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null)

  const usernameIsLowerCase = username === username.toLowerCase()
  const usernameIsLongEnough = username.length >= 3
  const usernameIsShortEnough = username.length <= 10
  const formIsValid =
    usernameIsShortEnough && usernameIsLongEnough && usernameIsLowerCase

  const displayErrorMessage = touched && !formIsValid

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (displayErrorMessage) usernameInputRef.current?.focus()
  }, [displayErrorMessage])

  let errorMessage = null
  if (!usernameIsLowerCase) {
    errorMessage = 'Username must be lower case'
  } else if (!usernameIsLongEnough) {
    errorMessage = 'Username must be at least 3 characters long'
  } else if (!usernameIsShortEnough) {
    errorMessage = 'Username must be no longer than 10 characters'
  }

  function handleSubmit(event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {
    event.preventDefault()
    setTouched(true)
    if (!formIsValid) return

    onSubmitUsername(username)
  }

  function handleChange(event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
    setUsername(event.currentTarget.value)
  }

  function handleBlur() {
    setTouched(true)
  }

  return (
    <form name="usernameForm" onSubmit={handleSubmit} noValidate>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="usernameInput">Username:</label>
        <input
          ref={usernameInputRef}
          id="usernameInput"
          type="text"
          value={username}
          onChange={handleChange}
          onBlur={handleBlur}
          pattern="[a-z]{3,10}"
          required
          aria-describedby={displayErrorMessage ? 'error-message' : undefined}
        />
      </div>
      {displayErrorMessage ? (
        <div role="alert" className="error-message">
          {errorMessage}
        </div>
      ) : null}
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

There's a bit going on there, but let's zoom in on the `useEffect`. That's
responsible for focusing the input when an error is displayed so the user can
fix the problem.

```tsx
React.useEffect(() => {
  if (displayErrorMessage) usernameInputRef.current?.focus()
}, [displayErrorMessage])
```

If you know me, you know that [I'm a firm proponent](/myths-about-useeffect) of
the `exhaustive-deps` rule from the
[`eslint-plugin-react-hooks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks)
package. So you might wonder why my dependency array doesn't include:
`usernameInputRef.current`. Isn't that one of the dependencies of my effect
callback? After all, what would happen if that value were to change?

Well, let's try adding it to the array:

```tsx
React.useEffect(() => {
  if (displayErrorMessage) usernameInputRef.current?.focus()
}, [displayErrorMessage, usernameInputRef.current])
```

Ah, we get a lint warning from the `exhuastive-deps` rule:

```
React Hook React.useEffect has an unnecessary dependency: 'usernameInputRef.current'.
Either exclude it or remove the dependency array.
Mutable values like 'usernameInputRef.current' aren't valid dependencies because
mutating them doesn't re-render the component.
eslint(react-hooks/exhaustive-deps)
```

Alright, let's dig into that warning. Remember:

**`useRef` is similar to `useState` except changing the value doesn't trigger a
re-render.**

In our example above, we're using `useRef` to keep track of a DOM node, but you
can use it to keep track of any value whatsoever, just like `useState` (bet you
didn't think about putting a function in `useState` before did you ðŸ˜‰, you
totally can though).

The fact that an update the a `ref.current` value doesn't trigger a re-render is
an intentional feature. React doesn't keep track of the `current` value of a
ref. You're responsible for referencing and mutating that value yourself.
Because referencing DOM nodes is such a common use case, React will set the
`current` value for you when you pass a `ref` prop to an element. But other than
that, all React promises is that it will store your object and associate it to a
particular instance of a component for as long as that component exists.

By the way, that's what differentiates a `ref` from just a regular variable
outside the component. `useRef` ensures that the value is associated with a
particular instance of a component.

Alright, so let's bring this back to the warning. Let's recall the purpose of a
dependency array: It's there so React can do something when there are changes in
the values provided each time the component renders. And that's the answer right
there! React can't know that the value changed if a change doesn't trigger a
render! Here's a quick contrived example:

```tsx
function Counter() {
  const countRef = React.useRef(0)

  React.useEffect(() => {
    console.log(countRef.current)
  }, [countRef.current])

  const increment = () => (countRef.current += 1)
  return <button onClick={increment}>Click me</button>
}
```

I can click that button over and over again, but I'm never going to get that
`useEffect` callback to run again because there's no re-render associated to the
update in the value, I won't get any updated logs!

"_But Kent_" you ask, "_what if I *want* an update to a ref to result in a
re-render?_" If that's the case, what you actually want is
`useState`/`useReducer`, not `useRef`!

## The rule that governs exceptions to the `exhaustive-deps` rule

So refs are an exception to the `exhaustive-deps` rule, but they're actually not
the only exception. The exception itself is general. Here's the general rule for
the exception:

**Anything you use in your effect callback that won't trigger a re-render when
updated should not go into the dependency array.**

Additionally (and consequentially), you should not expect any change in such
values to result in the effect callback getting called. If you _need_ the
callback to be called when those things change, then you _need_ to put it in
`useState` (or `useReducer`).

This general rule is why if you pass the value of a module-level variable into a
dependency array like this you'll get a similar lint warning:

```tsx
let log = console.log

function Comp() {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    log(new Date())
  }, [log]) // <-- ðŸš¨ eslint warning here
  return <div>{/* stuff here */}</div>
}
```

Here's what the linter will tell you about that:

```
React Hook React.useEffect has an unnecessary dependency: 'log'.
Either exclude it or remove the dependency array. Outer scope values like 'log'
aren't valid dependencies because mutating them doesn't re-render the component.
eslint(react-hooks/exhaustive-deps)
```

This is because even if I did reassign that `log` variable to something else at
some point, React wouldn't know about it so you'd end up with a stale
side-effect anyway. So just don't list it, and if you _do_ want a change to
trigger the effect to run, then put it in state!

Same thing happens with imports (with the added benefit of the fact that you
can't reassign these values anyway):

```tsx
import log from './logger'

function Comp() {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    log(new Date())
  }, [log]) // <-- ðŸš¨ eslint warning here
  return <div>{/* stuff here */}</div>
}
```

The lint warning for this is actually identical to the variable form.

## Custom hooks and the ref object itself

You won't get a warning with code like this:

```tsx
function Comp() {
  const logRef = React.useRef(console.log)
  React.useEffect(() => {
    logRef.current(new Date())
  }, []) // <-- âœ… No eslint warning here
  return <div>{/* stuff here */}</div>
}
```

That's because you're not using any values in your `useEffect` that the lint
plugin knows can change on re-renders.

However, you also won't get a warning with code like this:

```tsx
function Comp() {
  const logRef = React.useRef(console.log)
  React.useEffect(() => {
    logRef.current(new Date())
  }, [logRef]) // <-- âœ… No eslint warning here
  return <div>{/* stuff here */}</div>
}
```

That's because the `logRef` value _can never change_. So it actually makes no
difference whether you include it or not and I guess the authors of the lint
rule decided to not bother you about something that doesn't matter. Good call.

But here's an interesting case. What about a custom hook that accepts a ref?

```tsx
function useDateCall(cbRef) {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    cbRef.current(new Date())
  }, []) // <-- ðŸš¨ eslint warning here
}

function Comp() {
  const logRef = React.useRef(console.log)
  useDateCall(logRef)
  return <div>{/* stuff here */}</div>
}
```

The warning we get there is:

```
React Hook React.useEffect has a missing dependency: 'cbRef'.
Either include it or remove the dependency array.
eslint(react-hooks/exhaustive-deps)
```

The reason we get the warning there when we didn't get it within the component
is because ESLint is pretty limited in its ability to trace what you're doing
with your JavaScript. So the React plugin for ESLint can't know that `cbRef` is
actually a `ref`. So just to be safe, it warns you.

Luckily, as we just learned, including it in the dependency array doesn't make
any difference anyway, so just include it!

```tsx
function useDateCall(cbRef) {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    cbRef.current(new Date())
  }, [cbRef]) // <-- âœ… No eslint warning here
}

function Comp() {
  const logRef = React.useRef(console.log)
  useDateCall(logRef)
  return <div>{/* stuff here */}</div>
}
```

And we're all good.

## Conclusion

So the reason you shouldn't list a ref in your `useEffect` dependency array is
because it's an indication that you want the effect callback to re-run when a
value is changed, but you're not notifying React when that change happens. So
the solution is to either:

1. Not include it in the array
2. Put that value in `useState`/`useReducer` so an update will trigger a render.

Hope that cleared up some confusion for you! Good luck.
