So, you've got some code in `React.useEffect` and you want to know how to test
it. This is a pretty common question. The answer is kinda anti-climatic and
general. Here's how you think about testing _anything_:

> How does the user make that code run? Make your test do that.

That's it. That's the secret. The trick is discovering what constitutes a
"user." Your React components actually have 2 users: the developer who renders
it and the end-user who interacts with it. Generally, your tests should do no
more or less than what these users do. For more on this, read
[Avoid the Test User](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/avoid-the-test-user).

So, let's take a look at an example. I'll grab some code from one of the
exercises in [EpicReact.dev/app](https://epicreact.dev/app) (it's a pretty long
example, feel free to scan it quickly):

```javascript
/** @jsx jsx */
import {jsx} from '@emotion/core'

import * as React from 'react'
import Tooltip from '@reach/tooltip'
import {FaSearch, FaTimes} from 'react-icons/fa'
import {Input, BookListUL, Spinner} from './components/lib'
import {BookRow} from './components/book-row'
import {client} from './utils/api-client'
import * as colors from './styles/colors'

function DiscoverBooksScreen() {
  const [status, setStatus] = React.useState('idle')
  const [data, setData] = React.useState()
  const [error, setError] = React.useState()
  const [query, setQuery] = React.useState()
  const [queried, setQueried] = React.useState(false)

  const isLoading = status === 'loading'
  const isSuccess = status === 'success'
  const isError = status === 'error'

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (!queried) {
      return
    }
    setStatus('loading')
    client(`books?query=${encodeURIComponent(query)}`).then(
      (responseData) => {
        setData(responseData)
        setStatus('success')
      },
      (errorData) => {
        setError(errorData)
        setStatus('error')
      },
    )
  }, [query, queried])

  function handleSearchSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    setQueried(true)
    setQuery(event.target.elements.search.value)
  }

  return (
    <div
      css={{maxWidth: 800, margin: 'auto', width: '90vw', padding: '40px 0'}}
    >
      <form onSubmit={handleSearchSubmit}>
        <Input
          placeholder="Search books..."
          id="search"
          css={{width: '100%'}}
        />
        <Tooltip label="Search Books">
          <label htmlFor="search">
            <button
              type="submit"
              css={{
                border: '0',
                position: 'relative',
                marginLeft: '-35px',
                background: 'transparent',
              }}
            >
              {isLoading ? (
                <Spinner />
              ) : isError ? (
                <FaTimes aria-label="error" css={{color: colors.danger}} />
              ) : (
                <FaSearch aria-label="search" />
              )}
            </button>
          </label>
        </Tooltip>
      </form>

      {isError ? (
        <div css={{color: colors.danger}}>
          <p>There was an error:</p>
          <pre>{error.message}</pre>
        </div>
      ) : null}

      {isSuccess ? (
        data?.books?.length ? (
          <BookListUL css={{marginTop: 20}}>
            {data.books.map((book) => (
              <li key={book.id} aria-label={book.title}>
                <BookRow key={book.id} book={book} />
              </li>
            ))}
          </BookListUL>
        ) : (
          <p>No books found. Try another search.</p>
        )
      ) : null}
    </div>
  )
}

export {DiscoverBooksScreen}
```

Let's look at this bit specifically:

```javascript
React.useEffect(() => {
  if (!queried) {
    return
  }
  setStatus('loading')
  client(`books?query=${encodeURIComponent(query)}`).then(
    (responseData) => {
      setData(responseData)
      setStatus('success')
    },
    (errorData) => {
      setError(errorData)
      setStatus('error')
    },
  )
}, [query, queried])

function handleSearchSubmit(event) {
  event.preventDefault()
  setQueried(true)
  setQuery(event.target.elements.search.value)
}
```

Because we've properly mocked our backend using [MSW](https://mswjs.io/) (learn
more about that in
[Stop Mocking Fetch](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/stop-mocking-fetch)), we can
actually make that request and get results. So let's interact with this
component just the same way the end user would. Here's a test that actually
works with this code:

```javascript
import * as React from 'react'
import {
  render,
  screen,
  waitForElementToBeRemoved,
  within,
} from '@testing-library/react'
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'
import {DiscoverBooksScreen} from '../discover.extra-1'

// Learn more: https://kentcdodds.com/blog/stop-mocking-fetch
import {server} from 'test/server'
beforeAll(() => server.listen())
afterAll(() => server.close())
afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers())

test('queries for books', async () => {
  // ðŸ¤“ this is what developer users do
  render(<DiscoverBooksScreen />)

  // ðŸ¤  this is what end users do
  userEvent.type(
    screen.getByRole('textbox', {name: /search/i}),
    'Sanderson{enter}',
  )
  // ðŸ¤  end users will also note the presence of the loading indicator
  // and wait until it's gone before making som assertions
  await waitForElementToBeRemoved(() => screen.getByLabelText(/loading/i))

  // ðŸ¤  end users will look at all the items in the list to see the book titles
  // Also, assistive technologies will take advantage of the implicit "listitem"
  // ARIA role of our `li` elements.
  const results = screen.getAllByRole('listitem').map((listItem) => {
    return within(listItem).getByRole('heading', {level: 2}).textContent
  })
  // I rarely use snapshots, but this seemed like a pretty good application:
  // https://kcd.im/snapshots
  expect(results).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`
    Array [
      "The Way of Kings (Book 1 of the Stormlight Archive)",
      "Words of Radiance (Book 2 of the Stormlight Archive)",
      "Oathbringer (Book 3 of the Stormlight Archive)",
    ]
  `)
})
```

There are other ways I could write this test (there are some important things
that happen in that `test/server` module that we don't have time to cover in
this post), but the principles are all the same:

> How does the user make that code run? Make your test do that.

Stated differently:

> The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more
> confidence they can give you.

So don't try mocking `useEffect` or `useState` or whatever. Stay away from that
third user (the dreaded test user). The only thing that user is good for is
turning you into a glorified test babysitter. And I don't know about you, but
I'd rather ship awesome stuff to real people.
