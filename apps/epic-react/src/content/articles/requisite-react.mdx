When was the last time you saw an error and had _no idea_ what it meant (and
therefore no idea what to do about it)? Today? Yeah, you're not alone... Let's
talk about how to fix that.

## A story

A while ago, I got a new faucet. It's one of those cool ones where the head of
the faucet could come off so we could direct the water's flow and would
automatically retract back into the neck when you're done. Unfortunately, it
wasn't long before we had a problem:

![Faucet with the head not retracting into the neck](/articles-images/requisite-react/broken-faucet.png)

The head of the faucet wouldn't automatically go back into the neck! And we
couldn't even push it back in. It just hung there. Like a sad flower ðŸ¥€

So we called the plumber who had installed it for us to have them come look at
it and see if they could fix it or give us a replacement. A few days later was
the day of our appointment. A few hours before he arrived, I looked
frustratingly at the faucet and wondered... So I looked under the sink, and this
is what I saw:

That's the hose for our faucet. It turns out there's a simple weight that goes
on the hose and that weight is what pulls the head of the faucet into the neck.
Because it was tangled in itself, the weight wasn't pulling the hose down. So I
reached in and untangled the hose:

And like a miracle, it suddenly worked! I called the plumber to cancel as
quickly as I could to avoid revealing my shame. Can you imagine if I hadn't
discovered the problem and they came over, untangled the hose, and gave me an
invoice for their trouble. I don't know if I could have taken that hit to my
ego. The embarrassment would have been too much ðŸ™ˆ

So what does a faucet problem have to do with React? A faucet is an abstraction.
We don't have to have faucets. We could just pull the hose straight out of the
wall and use that instead, but we put the faucet in place because it makes the
water more useful. Normally it works fine, but when there's a problem, if you
don't understand how the abstraction works, it's difficult to figure out what
went wrong and how to resolve the problem.

## A universal truth

React is an abstraction too. And here's a universal truth about abstractions:

https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1074724545003581440

Abstractions are all around us. Your phone is an abstraction. Your car is an
abstraction. And the better we understand how those things work, the better we
are able to use them. And that's not to say that you _can't_ use the abstraction
if you don't know how they work. I drive my car all the time and I have no idea
how it works. But whenever something goes wrong with it, I'm at a total loss
(and that's just the way my mechanic likes it ðŸ¤‘).

You can use React without a good foundation in the fundamentals and that's
totally fine. You can ship really amazing things without a solid foundation. But
if you'd like to level-up on your capabilities and productivity with React, then
digging in and gaining an understanding in how they work is the way to do it.

## A simple example

There's a fun site
[YouMightNotNeedjQuery.com](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/) which shows
common jQuery functions and the code needed for that same functionality based on
the browser support you have (up to IE10).

So let's imagine that you needed
[jQuery's `toggleClass` functionality](https://api.jquery.com/toggleclass/) so
you copy/pasted the code from YouMightNotNeedjQuery.com and built this function
so you don't have to bring all of jQuery into your app:

```javascript
function toggleClass(el, className) {
  if (el.classList) {
    el.classList.toggle(className)
  } else {
    var classes = el.className.split(' ')
    var existingIndex = -1
    for (var i = classes.length; i--; ) {
      if (classes[i] === className) existingIndex = i
    }

    if (existingIndex >= 0) classes.splice(existingIndex, 1)
    else classes.push(className)

    el.className = classes.join(' ')
  }
}
```

What you've created is your own little abstraction. But actually, you're also
_using_ an abstraction: the DOM. And if you knew a little bit more about that
abstraction, you'd know that browsers (including IE10) have support for this
built-in. So that function could be simplified... a lot:

```javascript
function toggleClass(el, className) {
  el.classList.toggle(className)
}
```

So by understanding the abstraction we're using (the DOM in this case), we're
able to drastically simplify our code which ultimately
[impacts our users](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/why-users-care-about-how-you-write-code).

## A problem with learning abstractions

These days not many people build an application without using a soup of tools
and libraries to do so. Unfortunately, if you skip over the fundamentals of each
tool, it's easy for your understanding of each to become muddled. Is React
managing my state or React Query? Is Babel compiling my JSX or React? Do I need
PropTypes if I'm using TypeScript? Isn't redux required if you're building a
React app? (That last one is a definite no).

One of the biggest causes for people's struggle at understanding abstractions is
they struggle to draw lines around the abstractions. When you're not sure which
abstraction should do which job, it's very easy to use the wrong tool for the
job. Sure you can get it working eventually, but you may be left with a solution
that causes you and ultimately your users some real pain.

So a great first step to understanding your abstractions better is to learn them
in isolation from one another and only add them to your learning when you run
into the problem they actually solve.

Too many people start learning and using React with Webpack, Babel, React
Router, Redux, Jest, React Testing Library, Material UI, etc. etc. This makes it
really difficult to draw lines around these abstractions and really understand
the purpose of each.

## A different approach

This is why [EpicReact.Dev](https://epicreact.dev) introduces one concept at a
time. And we don't skip anything. As you just get started, we literally write
JavaScript in a script tag of an HTML file. We don't even write React first. We
start with regular DOM nodes. Then we add `React.createElement`. Then we add
JSX. And we methodically add more and more concepts over time so you get a good
idea of what tools are responsible for what so you can use each as effectively
as possible.

This is why people who have been using React for _years_ tell me that they
_still_ learn new things from my beginner material. Because we so often skip
over that methodical approach when we're in a rush to ship something.

## Time to level-up

If you're tired of seeing errors pop up in your console and not understanding
what to do about them, then gaining a deeper understanding of the fundamentals
of how things work is the best thing you can do to get over that. If you're
tired of fumbling around with wiring things together and praying that nobody
blows your house of cards over, then taking a bit to sharpen your understanding
of your primary abstractions (like React) will go a long way.

And this is exactly why I created [EpicReact.Dev](https://epicreact.dev): To
help you level-up your professional React knowledge and productivity.
