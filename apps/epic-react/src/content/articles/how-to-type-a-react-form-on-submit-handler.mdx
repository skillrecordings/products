Here's a form in `JSX`:

```jsx
function UsernameForm({onSubmitUsername}) {
  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    onSubmitUsername(event.currentTarget.elements.usernameInput.value)
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="usernameInput">Username:</label>
        <input id="usernameInput" type="text" />
      </div>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

Let's type that `handleSubmit` function. Here's how some people do it (copying
this approach from some blog posts and "semi-official guides" I've seen):

```tsx
function handleSubmit(event: React.SyntheticEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {
  event.preventDefault()
  const form = event.currentTarget
  const formElements = form.elements as typeof form.elements & {
    usernameInput: {value: string}
  }
  onSubmitUsername(formElements.usernameInput.value)
}
```

The reason we have to have the `as` there is because TypeScript isn't quite
smart enough to know what elements we're rendering in our form, so we have to
use the type cast which I'm not a fan of, but you gotta ship right?

My first improvement to this is to change that `usernameInput` type:

```diff
-     usernameInput: {value: string}
+     usernameInput: HTMLInputElement
```

Definitely take advantage of the type it actually is rather than just
cherry-picking the values you need.

The second improvement is:

```diff
- function handleSubmit(event: React.SyntheticEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {
+ function handleSubmit(event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {
```

Incidentally, at the time of this writing, there's no substantive difference in
those types, but I prefer to be more clear and accurate with the name of the
type, so that's what we're going to go with.

So here we are now:

```tsx
function handleSubmit(event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {
  event.preventDefault()
  const form = event.currentTarget
  const formElements = form.elements as typeof form.elements & {
    usernameInput: HTMLInputElement
  }
  onSubmitUsername(formElements.usernameInput.value)
}
```

But even with those changes, I'm not a fan of this for three reasons:

1. It's a bit verbose and distracts from the main purpose of the function
2. If I need to use that `form` anywhere else, I'll either have to duplicate the
   code or extract the type and cast it everywhere I use the form.
3. I don't like seeing `as` in my code because it is a signal that I'm telling
   the TypeScript compiler to pipe down (be less helpful). So I try to avoid it
   when possible. And it is possible!

Keep in mind that _we're_ the ones telling TypeScript what that
`event.currentTarget` type is. We tell TypeScript when we specify the type for
our `event`. Right now that's set to `React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>`. So
we're telling TypeScript that `event.currentTarget` is an `HTMLFormElement` but
then we immediately tell TypeScript that this isn't quite right by using `as`.
What if instead we just tell TypeScript more accurately what it is at the start?
Yeah, let's do that.

```tsx
interface FormElements extends HTMLFormControlsCollection {
  usernameInput: HTMLInputElement
}
interface UsernameFormElement extends HTMLFormElement {
  // now we can override the elements type to be an HTMLFormControlsCollection
  // of our own design...
  readonly elements: FormElements
}
```

So in reality, our `form` is an `HTMLFormElement` with some known `elements`. So
we extend `HTMLFormElement` and override the `elements` to have the elements we
want it to. The `HTMLFormElement['elements']` type is a
`HTMLFormControlsCollection`, so make our own version of that interface as well.

With that, now we can update our type and get rid of all the type casting!

Here's the whole thing altogether:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react'

interface FormElements extends HTMLFormControlsCollection {
  usernameInput: HTMLInputElement
}
interface UsernameFormElement extends HTMLFormElement {
  readonly elements: FormElements
}

function UsernameForm({
  onSubmitUsername,
}: {
  onSubmitUsername: (username: string) => void
}) {
  function handleSubmit(event: React.FormEvent<UsernameFormElement>) {
    event.preventDefault()
    onSubmitUsername(event.currentTarget.elements.usernameInput.value)
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="usernameInput">Username:</label>
        <input id="usernameInput" type="text" />
      </div>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

So now:

1. the type information is removed from the `handleSubmit` code, allowing us to
   focus on what the function is doing.
2. If we need to use this `form` somewhere else, we can give it the
   `UsernameFormElement` type and get all the type help we need.
3. We don't have to use a type cast, so TypeScript can be more useful for us.

I hope that's helpful to you!
