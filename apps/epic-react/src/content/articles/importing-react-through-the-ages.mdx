Before we get started, here's a brief look of valid (today) ways to import React
and use the `useState` hook:

```javascript
// global
window.React.useState()

// CommonJS
const React = require('react')
React.useState()

// ESModules default import
import React from 'react'
React.useState()

// ESModules named import
import {useState} from 'react'
useState()

// ESModules namespace import
import * as React from 'react'
React.useState()
```

Below I'll explain where each of these mechanisms came from and why I prefer the
last one.

## Before the dawn of time

I started writing React code back in the `React.createClass` days. Here's how we
did things back then:

```javascript
var React = require('react')

var Counter = React.createClass({
  propTypes: {
    initialCount: React.PropTypes.number.isRequired,
    step: React.PropTypes.number,
  },
  getDefaultProps: function () {
    return {step: 1}
  },
  getInitialState: function () {
    var initialCount = this.props.hasOwnProperty('initialCount')
      ? this.props.initialCount
      : 0
    return {count: initialCount}
  },

  changeCount: function (change) {
    this.setState(function (previousState) {
      return {count: previousState.count + change}
    })
  }

  increment: function () {
    this.changeCount(this.props.step)
  },

  decrement: function () {
    this.changeCount(-this.props.step)
  },

  render: function () {
    return (
      <div>
        <div>Current Count: {this.state.count}</div>
        <button onClick={this.decrement}>-</button>
        <button onClick={this.increment}>+</button>
      </div>
    )
  },
})
```

Yup, `var`, `React.createClass`, `require`, `function`. Good times.

## Classes and Modules

Eventually, we got ES6 (and later) which included modules, classes, and some
other syntax niceties:

```javascript
import React from 'react'

class Counter extends React.Component {
  state = {count: this.props.initialCount ?? 0}
  changeCount() {
    this.setState(({count}) => ({count + change}))
  }
  increment = () => this.changeCount(this.props.step)
  decrement = () => this.changeCount(-this.props.step)
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <div>Current Count: {this.state.count}</div>
        <button onClick={this.decrement}>-</button>
        <button onClick={this.increment}>+</button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

This is when the "how should I import React" question started popping up. A lot
of people preferred doing this:

```javascript {1, 3}
import React, {Component} from 'react'

class Counter extends Component {
  state = {count: this.props.initialCount ?? 0}
  changeCount() {
    this.setState(({count}) => ({count + change}))
  }
  increment = () => this.changeCount(this.props.step)
  decrement = () => this.changeCount(-this.props.step)
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <div>Current Count: {this.state.count}</div>
        <button onClick={this.decrement}>-</button>
        <button onClick={this.increment}>+</button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

Normally this sort of thing isn't even a question. You just do what the library
exposes. But React never actually exposed ESModules. It exposes itself as either
a global variable called `React` or a CommonJS module which is the `React`
object which has `Component` on it (along with other things). But because of the
way the code is compiled, both approaches technically work and neither is
technically "wrong."

One other note... Looking at the code above you might wonder why we can't change
that to:

```diff
- import React, {Component} from 'react'
+ import {Component} from 'react'
```

The reason you need `React` in there is because (at the time) JSX was compiled
to use React:

```diff
- <button onClick={this.increment}>+</button>
+ React.createElement('button', {onClick: this.increment}, '+')
```

So if you use JSX, you need to have `React` imported as well.

It wasn't long after this that function components became a thing. Even though
at the time these couldn't actually be used to manage state or side-effects,
they became very popular. I (and many others) got very accustomed to refactoring
from class to function and back again (many people just decided it was easier to
use class components all the time).

For me, I preferred using function components as much as possible and this is
likely the reason that I preferred using `import React from 'react'` and
`React.Component` rather than `import React, {Component} from 'react'`. I didn't
like having to update my import statement any time I refactored from class
components to function components and vice-versa. Oh, and I know that
IDEs/editors like VSCode and WebStorm have automatic import features, but I
never found those to work very well (I ran into stuff like
[this](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library/issues/642#issuecomment-718926429)
all the time).

Oh, and one other interesting fact. If you were using TypeScript instead of
Babel, then you'd actually be required to do `import * as React from 'react'`
unless you enabled
[`allowSyntheticDefaultImports`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#allowSyntheticDefaultImports).

## The Age of Hooks

Then hooks took the scene and the way I wrote components evolved again:

```javascript
import React from 'react'

function Counter({initialCount = 0, step}) {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(initialCount)
  const decrement = () => setCount((c) => c - step)
  const increment = () => setCount((c) => c + step)
  return (
    <div>
      <div>Current Count: {count}</div>
      <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
      <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This brought up another question on how to import React. We had two ways to use
hooks:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
// ...
const [count, setCount] = React.useState(initialCount)

// alternatively:
import React, {useState} from 'react'
// ...
const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount)
```

So again, should we do named imports, or just reference things directly on
`React`? Again, for me, I prefer to not have to update my imports every time I
add/remove hooks from my files (and again, I don't trust IDE auto-import), so I
prefer `React.useState` over `useState`.

## The new JSX transform and the future of React + ESM

Finally, React 17 was released with basically no real breaking changes but
[an announcement](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html)
of great import (pun intended): There's a new JSX transform that means you no
longer need to import React to transform JSX. So now you can write:

```javascript
function App() {
  return <h1>Hello World</h1>
}
```

And this will get compiled to:

```javascript
// Inserted by a compiler (don't import it yourself!)
import {jsx as _jsx} from 'react/jsx-runtime'

function App() {
  return _jsx('h1', {children: 'Hello world'})
}
```

So the import happens automatically now! That's great, but that also means that
if you want to migrate to use this new capability, you'll need to remove any
`import React from 'react'` that's just for JSX. Luckily the React team made a
script to do this automatically, but they had to make a decision on how to
handle situations where you're using hooks. You have two options:

```javascript
import * as React from 'react'
const [count, setCount] = React.useState(initialCount)

// or
import {useState} from 'react'
const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount)
```

Both of these work today, are technically correct, and will continue to work
into the future when React finally exposes an official ESModules build.

The React team decided to go with the named imports approach. I disagree with
this decision for reasons mentioned above (having to update my import all the
time). So for me, I'm now using the `import * as React from 'react'` which is a
mouthful for my hands to type, so I have a snippet:

```javascript
// snippets/javascript.json
{
  "import React": {
    "prefix": "ir",
    "body": ["import * as React from 'react'\n"]
  },
}
```

So here's the current state of things:

For me, I'm sticking with `import * as React from 'react'` so I don't have to
worry about my imports. And that's my overly long blog post answer for a very
common question I get. Hope it was helpful!
