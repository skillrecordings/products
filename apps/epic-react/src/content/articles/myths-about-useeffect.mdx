excerpt: Some common mistakes I see people make with useEffect and how to avoid them.
---

I've taught React to tens of thousands of developers. Before and after hooks
were released. One thing I've observed is people tend to struggle with the
`useEffect` hook and there are some common hang-ups for them that I'd like to
address here.

## ‚ùå Lifecycles ‚ùå ‚úÖ Synchronize Side Effects ‚úÖ

The biggest struggle I've observed is developers who have experience with React
class components and lifecycle hooks like `constructor`, `componentDidMount`,
`componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`. You can definitely map these
to function components with hooks, but that's a big mistake. Allow me to
illustrate. Here's an example of some fun UI:

![User clicks "Bernedoodle" link and information about a Bernedoodle shows up, then the user clicks "Poodle" and poodle info shows up. Then back to "Bernedoodle", then "Bernese Mountain Dog", then "return to list"](/articles-images/myths-about-useeffect/dogs.gif)

Here's a class component implementation of that `DogInfo` component:

```javascript
class DogInfo extends React.Component {
  controller = null
  state = {dog: null}
  // we'll ignore error/loading states for brevity
  fetchDog() {
    this.controller?.abort()

    this.controller = new AbortController()
    getDog(this.props.dogId, {signal: this.controller.signal}).then(
      (dog) => {
        this.setState({dog})
      },
      (error) => {
        // handle the error
      },
    )
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    this.fetchDog()
  }
  componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
    // handle the dogId change
    if (prevProps.dogId !== this.props.dogId) {
      this.fetchDog()
    }
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    // cancel the request on unmount
    this.controller?.abort()
  }
  render() {
    return <div>{/* render dog's info */}</div>
  }
}
```

That's a pretty standard class component for this type of interaction. It's
using the `constructor`, `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and
`componentWillUnmount` lifecycle hooks. If we naively mapped those lifecycles to
hooks, here's how it might look:

```javascript
function DogInfo({dogId}) {
  const controllerRef = React.useRef(null)
  const [dog, setDog] = React.useState(null)
  function fetchDog() {
    controllerRef.current?.abort()

    controllerRef.current = new AbortController()
    getDog(dogId, {signal: controllerRef.current.signal}).then(
      (d) => setDog(d),
      (error) => {
        // handle the error
      },
    )
  }

  // didMount
  React.useEffect(() => {
    fetchDog()
    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  }, [])

  // didUpdate
  const previousDogId = usePrevious(dogId)
  useUpdate(() => {
    if (previousDogId !== dogId) {
      fetchDog()
    }
  })

  // willUnmount
  React.useEffect(() => {
    return () => {
      controllerRef.current?.abort()
    }
  }, [])

  return <div>{/* render dog's info */}</div>
}

function usePrevious(value) {
  const ref = useRef()
  useEffect(() => {
    ref.current = value
  }, [value])
  return ref.current
}
```

There are still some holdouts on hooks. If this is what I thought hooks meant,
then I would be a hooks holdout too.

Here's the crux of the issue: **`useEffect` is _not_ a lifecycle hook. It's a
mechanism for synchronizing side effects with the state of your app.**

So, in our example, all we care about is: "When the `dogId` changes, fetch the
new dog's information." With that as our goal, `useEffect` becomes _much_
simpler for this case:

```javascript
function DogInfo({dogId}) {
  const [dog, setDog] = React.useState(null)

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const controller = new AbortController()
    getDog(dogId, {signal: controller.signal}).then(
      (d) => setDog(d),
      (error) => {
        // handle the error
      },
    )
    return () => controller.abort()
  }, [dogId])

  return <div>{/* render dog's info */}</div>
}
```

ü§Ø Oh snap. That's _way_ better right?! When the React team introduced hooks,
their goal wasn't to simply add lifecycles to function components. Their goal
was to fundamentally improve the mental model for application side-effects. And
they did.

Big time.

So remember this gem by
[Ryan Florence](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/1125041041063665666):

## I can ignore eslint-plugin-react-hooks/exhaustive-deps ‚ùå

Well, technically you can. And _sometimes_ there's a good reason to. But most of
the time it's a bad idea and ignoring that rule will lead to bugs. I see this
concern come up often when people say: "But I only want this to run on mount!"
Again. That's thinking in lifecycles and is wrong. If your `useEffect` callback
has dependencies, then you need to make sure that your effect callback is re-run
anytime those dependencies change. Otherwise your side-effects will fall out of
sync with the state of the app.

Long story short, you'll have bugs. Don't ignore this rule.

## One giant useEffect ‚ùå

Honestly, I don't see this one a whole lot, but I want to include it just in
case. No shame if this is you. It happens.

One of the things I love about `useEffect` over lifecycles is it allows me to
_really_ separate concerns. Here's a quick example:

![A geochat app showing location based chat, autoscroll, and unread count in the document title](/articles-images/myths-about-useeffect/geo-chat.gif)

Here's some pseudocode for that demo:

```javascript
class ChatFeed extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.subscribeToFeed()
    this.setDocumentTitle()
    this.subscribeToOnlineStatus()
    this.subscribeToGeoLocation()
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    this.unsubscribeFromFeed()
    this.restoreDocumentTitle()
    this.unsubscribeFromOnlineStatus()
    this.unsubscribeFromGeoLocation()
  }
  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    // ... compare props and re-subscribe etc.
  }
  render() {
    return <div>{/* chat app UI */}</div>
  }
}
```

See those four concerns? They're all mixed up. If we wanted to share that code
with anything else, it would be a mess. I mean, render props were awesome, but
hooks are _way_ better.

I've seen some people create a monster `useEffect` hook that does all the
things:

```javascript
function ChatFeed() {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    // subscribe to feed
    // set document title
    // subscribe to online status
    // subscribe to geo location
    return () => {
      // unsubscribe from feed
      // restore document title
      // unsubscribe from online status
      // unsubscribe from geo location
    }
  })

  return <div>{/* chat app UI */}</div>
}
```

But this makes that individual callback pretty complicated. I'd suggest a
different approach. Don't forget that you can separate logical concerns into
individual hooks:

```javascript
function ChatFeed() {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    // subscribe to feed
    return () => {
      // unsubscribe from feed
    }
  })

  React.useEffect(() => {
    // set document title
    return () => {
      // restore document title
    }
  })

  React.useEffect(() => {
    // subscribe to online status
    return () => {
      // unsubscribe from online status
    }
  })

  React.useEffect(() => {
    // subscribe to geo location
    return () => {
      // unsubscribe from geo location
    }
  })

  return <div>{/* chat app UI */}</div>
}
```

And with this approach, it's _much_ easier to extract this code into a custom
hook for each individual concern if that's what you need or want to do:

```javascript
function ChatFeed() {
  // NOTE: this is pseudo-code,
  // you'd likely need to pass values and assign return values
  useFeedSubscription()
  useDocumentTitle()
  useOnlineStatus()
  useGeoLocation()
  return <div>{/* chat app UI */}</div>
}
```

The self-encapsulation of hooks in general is a huge win. Let's make sure we
take advantage of that.

## Needlessly externally defined functions ‚ùå

I've seen this one a few times as well. Let me just give you a before/after:

```javascript
// before. Don't do this!
function DogInfo({dogId}) {
  const [dog, setDog] = React.useState(null)
  const controllerRef = React.useRef(null)

  const fetchDog = React.useCallback((dogId) => {
    controllerRef.current?.abort()
    controllerRef.current = new AbortController()
    return getDog(dogId, {signal: controllerRef.signal}).then(
      (d) => setDog(d),
      (error) => {
        // handle the error
      },
    )
  }, [])

  React.useEffect(() => {
    fetchDog(dogId)
    return () => controller.current?.abort()
  }, [dogId, fetchDog])

  return <div>{/* render dog's info */}</div>
}
```

We already saw how simple the above code can be in our earlier example, but let
me show that to you again:

```javascript
function DogInfo({dogId}) {
  const [dog, setDog] = React.useState(null)

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const controller = new AbortController()
    getDog(dogId, {signal: controller.signal}).then(
      (d) => setDog(d),
      (error) => {
        // handle the error
      },
    )
    return () => controller.abort()
  }, [dogId])

  return <div>{/* render dog's info */}</div>
}
```

The specific thing I'm trying to call out here is the idea of defining a
function like `fetchDog` outside of the `useEffect` callback. Because it's
external, you have to list it in the dependencies array to avoid stale closures.
And because of _that_ you also have to memoize it to avoid infinite loops. Oh,
and then we had to create a `ref` for our abort controller.

Phew, seems like a lot of work. If you _must_ define a function for your effect
to call, then do it _inside_ the effect callback, not outside.

## Conclusion

When Dan Abramov introduced hooks like `useEffect`, he compared React components
to atoms and hooks to electrons. They're a pretty low-level primitive, and
that's what makes them so powerful. The beauty of this primitive is that nicer
abstractions can be built on top of these hooks which is frankly something we
struggled with before hooks. Since the release of hooks, we've seen an explosion
of innovation and progress of good ideas and libraries built on top of this
primitive which ultimately helps us develop better apps.

I love it. And I want to teach you all about these primitives as well as
abstractions built on top of them in [EpicReact.Dev](https://epicreact.dev) üöÄ
