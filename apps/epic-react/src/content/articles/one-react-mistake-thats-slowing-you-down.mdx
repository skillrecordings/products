One thing that I like about React is that it allows me to write my components
like little black boxes of abstraction. I can look at a design and draw lines
around the UI elements and I know the components that I'm going to be making:

For example, here's my GitHub home page:

![GitHub homepage UI](/articles-images/one-react-mistake-thats-slowing-you-down/before.png)

Can you identify the different components you might create out of this design?
Here's how I look at it:

![The same UI with boxes around different UI elements](/articles-images/one-react-mistake-thats-slowing-you-down/marked-up.png)

Now, you might not need an individual component for all of these things, or you
may want _more_ components. It really depends on a variety of factors we won't
get into here. The mistake I want to point out is that the way we compose these
UI elements together in our code often makes a drastic difference on how
maintainable it is (as well as how often we feel "prop-drilling" pains).

Let's imagine how we might structure some of the components for this page:

```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <MainNav />
      <Homepage />
    </div>
  )
}

function MainNav() {
  return (
    <div>
      <GitHubLogo />
      <SiteSearch />
      <NavLinks />
      <NotificationBell />
      <CreateDropdown />
      <ProfileDropdown />
    </div>
  )
}

function Homepage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <LeftNav />
      <CenterContent />
      <RightContent />
    </div>
  )
}

function LeftNav() {
  return (
    <div>
      <DashboardDropdown />
      <Repositories />
      <Teams />
    </div>
  )
}

function CenterContent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <RecentActivity />
      <AllActivity />
    </div>
  )
}

function RightContent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Notices />
      <ExploreRepos />
    </div>
  )
}
```

We could keep going, but I think that's sufficient. You may have structured this
differently (or come up with a better name than `RightContent` ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), but based on
apps that I've built in the past as well as apps I've seen others build, this is
a pretty typical structure. Before I talk about some potential issues, let me
show you an alternative structure that takes advantage of React's brilliant
composition model. Then we can talk about the improvements and trade-offs.

```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <MainNav>
        <GitHubLogo />
        <SiteSearch />
        <NavLinks />
        <NotificationBell />
        <CreateDropdown />
        <ProfileDropdown />
      </MainNav>
      <Homepage
        leftNav={
          <LeftNav>
            <DashboardDropdown />
            <Repositories />
            <Teams />
          </LeftNav>
        }
        centerContent={
          <CenterContent>
            <RecentActivity />
            <AllActivity />
          </CenterContent>
        }
        rightContent={
          <RightContent>
            <Notices />
            <ExploreRepos />
          </RightContent>
        }
      />
    </div>
  )
}

function MainNav({children}) {
  return <div>{children}</div>
}

function Homepage({leftNav, centerContent, rightContent}) {
  return (
    <div>
      {leftNav}
      {centerContent}
      {rightContent}
    </div>
  )
}

function LeftNav({children}) {
  return <div>{children}</div>
}

function CenterContent({children}) {
  return <div>{children}</div>
}

function RightContent({children}) {
  return <div>{children}</div>
}
```

What's your initial reaction to this? Shock? Awe? Curiosity? Confusion? Disgust?
Is your initial reaction based on the fact that this is unfamiliar to you and
therefore should be shunned? If that's the case, then I invite you to pause and
consider this for a moment.

First, let me be clear that this use of React's composition capabilities can
probably be taken too far. Everything with moderation. The idea here is that our
structural components are responsible for layout. They likely won't do much to
manage state themselves (though they certainly could). They simply accept the
different stateful elements and then lay them out onto the page in the places
where they're supposed to appear. Most of the time, the `children` prop is
sufficient (in the Angular.js world, we call this "transclusion"), but sometimes
you might have several elements that you need to lay out, so you can use
specific and named props like our `Homepage` component (in the Vue.js world, we
call this "slots").

## But... Why?

So, why would we do this? The biggest and best reason to do this is for state
management. We're not showing any state use here, but let's imagine for a moment
that we needed to pass the user around. Consider the first example. Where would
you store the user's information? You'd probably store it in the `App` component
because that's the "lowest common parent" of the components that require that
state. From there you'd have to pass the `user`'s information (and potentially
mechanisms to update the user's information) as props.

This results in "prop-drilling". For example:
`<App /> -> <Homepage /> -> <CenterContent /> -> <AllActivity />` (and
potentially further). People have a pretty low tolerance for this, so you're
probably think that you'd use React's `context` API to solve this instead (so
would I).

But consider what this would look like for our second, more composed example.
You'd still need to store the `user` state in the `App` component, but what does
it look like to get the user's info to the `AllActivity` component now?
`<App /> -> <AllActivity />`. Boom. That's it.

## Conclusion

I think too many people go from "passing props" -> "context" too quickly. If we
structure our components with more composition in mind, then I think our
codebase will be more maintainable (you'll likely not need to open so many files
when you make changes) and we'll have fewer performance and state management
problems.

I'm excited to show you more on [EpicReact.Dev](https://epicreact.dev)!
