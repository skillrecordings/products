excerpt: The sneaky, surreptitious bug that React saved us from by using closures
---

When the world moved from React class components and lifecycle methods to React
function components and hooks, we left behind a bug that many of us didn't even
know was plaguing our class-based codebases. This bug was sneaky, hard to
identify and reproduce, and it would pop up in places due to seemingly harmless
changes over time. To make matters worse, the situations where it pops up are
not always bugs, sometimes it's an intended behavior. So you can't even lint
against it.

The bug has to do with the mutability of `this.props`. I'm not talking about
_you_ the developer mutating `this.props` (you shouldn't do that). I'm talking
about when the parent component re-renders and passes new props, `this.props`
suddenly points to completely new values. This is by design. I mean, when your
`render` method re-runs due to an update in the props, you don't want to render
the old props. You want the latest values so the React elements you return shows
the right information.

The problem is actually pretty simple. It typically crops up when you have an
event handler or lifecycle method that does something asynchronous. Imagine, you
start the async thing, then props change while that is in flight, when your code
continues `this.props` has the latest values rather than the values that existed
at the time the function started running.

Let's add some clarity to this. I've put together
[a little demo](https://react-and-stale-closures.netlify.app) which you can play
with below. When you click on the ❤️ button, that'll toggle the liked state, but
it has to do an async check to determine whether you're permitted to like/unlike
the post. That's hard-coded to take 3 seconds to give you time to experience the
problem. The specific use case is irrelevant. What matters more is the fact that
`this.props` gets changed from beneath you during that async operation.

So, in the demo below, try this:

1. Click the ❤️ button
2. Before the 3 seconds time is up, change the post selection
3. Observe differences

import Demo from '../../components/how-react-uses-closures-to-avoid-bugs'

<Demo />

You should observe that with the broken examples (like "The Old Default with
Classes"), the post that's updated is the currently active post.

Here's the code for that post (structured to optimize for minimizing
distraction):

```javascript
import * as React from 'react'
import {AppContext} from './provider'
import {canLike} from './utils'
import {PostView} from './post-view'

class Post extends React.Component {
  static contextType = AppContext
  handleLikeClick = async () => {
    if (!(await canLike(this.props.post, this.context.user))) return

    this.context.toggleLike(this.props.post)
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <PostView post={this.props.post} onLikeClick={this.handleLikeClick} />
    )
  }
}

export {Post}
```

The important bit here is the `canLike` utility that takes a while to run. So
when you click on ❤️, the code execution "pauses" for a little while before
continuing to the `this.context.toggleLike(this.props.post)` call. This means
that when you change the active post, `this.props.post` is pointing to the wrong
thing and the `toggleLike` call goes to the new post, not the one we were trying
to like.

This is easily solved, as demonstrated in the "Simulating The New Default with
Classes" example:

```javascript
handleLikeClick = async () => {
  const {post} = this.props
  const {user, toggleLike} = this.context
  if (!(await canLike(post, user))) return

  toggleLike(post)
}
```

Basically, we create a variable for everything our function is going to need
before we call the async `canLike` function. That way it doesn't matter what
happens with `this.props`, we're always referencing what `this.props.post` was
at the time ❤️ was clicked, which is what the user intended.

Oh, and did you notice the other potential bug that the refactor avoided? No?
Well you may have noticed that I _also_ destructure `user` and `toggleLike` from
`this.context`. This isn't just because I like the convention of destructuring
things at the top of the function. It's because if the `toggleLike` function
were to change on us during that async call then we may be calling a new version
of that function which references a different `user` resulting in that _new_
user liking the post instead of the one who clicked the button.

This bug bit me a few times with class components, so much that I created a
convention for myself to always destructure everything I needed from `this.` in
a function at the top of the function (like in the solution above).

But wouldn't it be better if we just changed the default? Yup! And that's what
hooks did for us!

Here's the code for "The New Default with Hooks" example:

```javascript
import * as React from 'react'
import {useApp} from './provider'
import {canLike} from './utils'
import {PostView} from './post-view'

function Post(props) {
  const {user, toggleLike} = useApp()

  async function handleLikeClick() {
    if (!(await canLike(props.post, user))) return

    toggleLike(props.post)
  }

  return <PostView post={props.post} onLikeClick={handleLikeClick} />
}

export {Post}
```

In this case, we don't need to worry because the `props` our component is called
with each render will _never_ change for all functions in the component. This is
because each render, all functions are created as brand-new functions. And when
a function is created, it grabs a reference to all variables outside of itself
and hangs onto it for as long as that function exists.

When a re-render is triggered, a new `props` object is created and passed to our
function component. At that time a _brand new_ `handleLikeClick` is created
which has reference to the latest version of `props`. But if an old version of
that function is still running, it's fine because it still has access to the
version of props it was called with to begin with. (If this concept is not
sinking in, you can learn more about
[how closures work here](https://whatthefork.is/closure)).

One interesting observation is that this example actually has nothing to do with
classes vs hooks, but really classes vs function components. But the same could
be said of `componentDidMount` vs `useEffect`.

Function components flip the default, and I would argue that it's a good trade
that helps us avoid that surreptitious bug.

## Simulate the old default

Just like it's possible to simulate the hooks default behavior with class
components, it's possible to simulate the classes default behavior with function
components. Here's the code for that example:

```javascript
import * as React from 'react'
import {useApp} from './provider'
import {canLike} from './utils'
import {PostView} from './post-view'

function Post(props) {
  const {user, toggleLike} = useApp()

  const postRef = React.useRef(props.post)
  React.useEffect(() => {
    postRef.current = props.post
  })

  async function handleLikeClick() {
    if (!(await canLike(postRef.current, user))) return

    toggleLike(postRef.current)
  }

  return <PostView post={props.post} onLikeClick={handleLikeClick} />
}

export {Post}
```

Refs allow you to update a value without trigger re-renders. It gives you a
similar mutable API to `this.` (when refactoring class components, `useRef` is
my go-to for any instance values if I can't simplify things as variables within
a single `useEffect`).

Of course, the above example is buggy, so you wouldn't do that. But are there
situations where the old default was a good idea? Most certainly! A good example
of such a case is a `debounce` function like this one
[Yago](https://twitter.com/yagopereiraaz) shared with me during my office hours
recently.

Here's a naive implementation of `debounce`:

```javascript
function debounce(fn, delay) {
  let timer
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timer)
    timer = setTimeout(() => {
      fn(...args)
    }, delay)
  }
}
```

And here's a naive implementation of a `useDebounce` hook:

```javascript
function useDebounce(callback, delay) {
  return debounce(callback, delay)
}
```

Unfortunately, that won't work because you be creating a brand new `debounce`ed
version of your function every render which results in the `debounce` `timer`
variable being different for each one so the debounce is actually just a `delay`
and doesn't actually debounce anything. So let's memoize that:

```javascript
function useDebounce(callback, delay) {
  return React.useMemo(() => debounce(callback, delay), [callback, delay])
}
```

The `callback` and `delay` are required, otherwise you'd end up with a debounce
function that can't react to changes in the `delay` and it would always call an
old version of the `callback` which would have access to old variables and
likely result in bugs.

However, this API means that someone would have to memoize the `callback`
otherwise you'd get a new debounce function every render which brings us back to
the problem that lead to use memoizing this in the first place:

```javascript
const myFn = React.useCallback(() => {
  // do debounced stuff
}, [vars, i, need])
const debouncedMyFn = useDebounce(myFn, 500)
```

But that's not a great API. This is one situation where the new default as
described above doesn't work very well. But we can use refs to get around the
problem!

```javascript
function useDebounce(callback, delay) {
  const callbackRef = React.useRef(callback)
  // Why useLayoutEffect? -> https://kcd.im/uselayouteffect
  React.useLayoutEffect(() => {
    callbackRef.current = callback
  })

  return React.useMemo(
    () => debounce((...args) => callbackRef.current(...args), delay),
    [delay],
  )
}
```

Sweet, so now people don't need to worry about memoizing their callback:

```javascript
const myFn = () => {
  // do debounced stuff
}
const debouncedMyFn = useDebounce(myFn, 500)
```

For this kind of use case, we should be safe from the aforementioned bug _and_
we have a nice API to boot. I'm satisfied.

If you're curious of real-world scenarios where people have done this to
simulate the old default, we actually build something like this in
[EpicReact.Dev's Advanced React Hooks Workshop](https://epicreact.dev/modules/advanced-react-hooks/usecallback-custom-hooks-intro)
with a custom `useAsync` hook. Dan Abramov's
[`useInterval` blog post](https://overreacted.io/making-setinterval-declarative-with-react-hooks/)
does this as well. And [`react-query`](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) does
this for your `queryFn`s.

## Conclusion

React made the decision to flip the default from things changing out from under
you to relying on closures to preserve the value of variables at the time a
function is defined. This helps us avoid non-obvious bugs and instead forces us
to confront issues before we ship to production. It can definitely be a little
confusing until you have a solid grasp on how closures work. Despite that, this
is a good change, and our apps are more bug-free thanks to it. 🚫🐛🚫
