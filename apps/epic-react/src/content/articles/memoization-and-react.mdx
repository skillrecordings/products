Memoization has to do with caching. Here's a super simple implementation of
memoization:

```javascript
const cache = {}
function addTwo(input) {
  if (!cache.hasOwnProperty(input)) {
    cache[input] = input + 2
  }
  return cache[input]
}
```

The basic idea is: hang on to the input and their associated output and return
that output again if called with the same input.

The point is to avoid re-calculating a value for which you already have the
result cached. In our case, we're avoiding "input + 2" ðŸ™ƒ

```javascript
addTwo(3) // 5
addTwo(3) // 5, but this time we got it from the cache ðŸ¤“
// (we didn't have to recalculate it)
// ðŸ¤“ I'll show up when we've memoized something
```

Maybe not entirely worthwhile for _this_ calculation, but it could/would be for
an expensive one.

Another interesting aspect to memoization is the fact that the cached value you
get back is _the same one_ you got last time. So:

```javascript
// let's imagine we have a function that returns an array of matching
// "post" objects:

// assuming getPostsNoMemo is not memoized
const posts1 = getPostsNoMemo('search term')
const posts2 = getPostsNoMemo('search term')
posts1 === posts2 // false (unique arrays)

// but if we memoize
// assuming getPostsMemo is memoized
const posts1 = getPostsMemo('search term')
const posts2 = getPostsMemo('search term')
posts1 === posts2 // true (identical array) ðŸ¤“
```

This has interesting implications for React we'll talk about in a second...

From there you need to talk about cache invalidation. If it's a pure function
you're memoizing, then you could keep the cache around forever... except you
might run into "out of memory" issues depending on how large the cache gets.
Cache invalidation is tricky and I'm not going to get into that today.

## React's memoization

React has three APIs for memoization: `memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`. The
caching strategy React has adopted has a size of 1. That is, they _only_ keep
around the most recent value of the input and result. There are various reasons
for this decision, but it satisfies the primary use case for memoizing in a
React context.

So for React's memoization it's more like this:

```javascript
let prevInput, prevResult
function addTwo(input) {
  if (input !== prevInput) {
    prevResult = input + 2
  }
  prevInput = input
  return prevResult
}
```

With that:

```javascript
addTwo(3) // 5 is computed
addTwo(3) // 5 is returned from the cache ðŸ¤“
addTwo(2) // 4 is computed
addTwo(3) // 5 is computed
```

To be clear, in React's case it's not a `!==` comparing the prevInput. It checks
equality of each prop and each dependency individually. Let's check each one:

```javascript
// React.memo's `prevInput` is props and `prevResult` is react elements (JSX)
const MemoComp = React.memo(Comp)

// then, when you render it:
<MemoComp prop1="a" prop2="b" /> // renders new elements

// rerender it with the same props:
<MemoComp prop1="a" prop2="b" /> // renders previous elements ðŸ¤“

// rerender it again but with different props:
<MemoComp prop1="a" prop2="c" /> // renders new elements

// rerender it again with the same props as at first:
<MemoComp prop1="a" prop2="b" /> // renders new elements
```

```javascript
// React.useMemo's `prevInput` is the dependency array
// and `prevResult` is whatever your function returns
const posts = React.useMemo(() => getPosts(searchTerm), [searchTerm])
// initial render with searchTerm = 'puppies':
// - getPosts is called
// - posts is a new array of posts

// rerender with searchTerm = 'puppies':
// - getPosts is *not* called
// - posts is the same as last time ðŸ¤“

// rerender with searchTerm = 'cats':
// - getPosts is called
// - posts is a new array of posts

// rerender render with searchTerm = 'puppies' (again):
// - getPosts is called
// - posts is a new array of posts
```

```javascript
// React.useCallback's `prevInput` is the dependency array
// and `prevResult` is the function
const launch = React.useCallback(
  () => launchCandy({type, distance}),
  [type, distance],
)
// initial render with type = 'twix' and distance = '15m':
// - launch is equal to the callback passed to useCallback this render

// rerender with type = 'twix' and distance = '15m':
// - launch is equal to the callback passed to useCallback last render ðŸ¤“

// rerender with same type = 'twix' and distance '20m':
// - launch is equal to the callback passed to useCallback this render

// rerender with type = 'twix' and distance = '15m':
// - launch is equal to the callback passed to useCallback this render
```

## The value of memoization in React

There are two reasons you might want to memoize something:

1. Improve performance by avoiding expensive computations (like re-rendering
   expensive components or calling expensive functions)
2. Value stability

I think we've covered the first point, but I want to make something clear about
the value stability benefit. In a React context, this value stability is
critical for memoization of other values as well as side-effects. Let's look at
a simple example:

```javascript
function App() {
  const [body, setBody] = React.useState()
  const [status, setStatus] = React.useState('idle')
  const fetchConfig = {
    method: 'POST',
    body,
    headers: {'content-type': 'application/json'},
  }

  const makeFetchRequest = () => (body ? fetch('/post', fetchConfig) : null)

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const promise = makeFetchRequest()

    // if no promise was returned, then we didn't make a request
    // so we'll exit early
    if (!promise) return

    setStatus('pending')
    promise.then(
      () => setStatus('fulfilled'),
      () => setStatus('rejected'),
    )
  }, [makeFetchRequest])

  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    // get form input values
    setBody(formInputValues)
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {/* form inputs and other neat stuff... */}
    </form>
  )
}
```

Take a guess at what's going to happen. If you guessed "runaway side-effect
loop" you're right! The reason is because `React.useEffect` will trigger a call
to the given effect callback whenever individual elements of the dependency
array changes. Our only dependency is `makeFetchRequest` and `makeFetchRequest`
is created within the component and that means it's new every render.

So this is where the value stability of memoization plays an important role in
React. So let's memoize `makeFetchRequest` with `useCallback`:

```javascript
const makeFetchRequest = React.useCallback(
  () => (body ? fetch('/post', fetchConfig) : null),
  [body, fetchConfig],
)
```

`useCallback` will only return a new function when the dependencies change. And
because of that, `makeFetchRequest` has a stable value between renders.
Unfortunately, `fetchConfig` is _also_ created within the component and that
means it's new every render as well. So let's memoize that for value stability:

```javascript
const fetchConfig = React.useMemo(() => {
  return {
    method: 'POST',
    body,
    headers: {'content-type': 'application/json'},
  }
}, [body])
```

Great! So now the `fetchConfig` and `makeFetchRequest` will both be stable and
will only change when the `body` changes which is what we want. Here's the final
version of this code:

```javascript
function App() {
  const [body, setBody] = React.useState()
  const [status, setStatus] = React.useState('idle')
  const fetchConfig = React.useMemo(() => {
    return {
      method: 'POST',
      body,
      headers: {'content-type': 'application/json'},
    }
  }, [body])

  const makeFetchRequest = React.useCallback(
    () => (body ? fetch('/post', fetchConfig) : null),
    [body, fetchConfig],
  )

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const promise = makeFetchRequest()
    // if no promise was returned, then we didn't make a request
    // so we'll exit early
    if (!promise) return

    setStatus('pending')
    promise.then(
      () => setStatus('fulfilled'),
      () => setStatus('rejected'),
    )
  }, [makeFetchRequest])

  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    // get form input values
    setBody(formInputValues)
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {/* form inputs and other neat stuff... */}
    </form>
  )
}
```

The value stability provided by `useCallback` for `makeFetchRequest` helps us
make sure that we can control when our side-effect runs. And the value stability
provided by `useMemo` for `fetchConfig` helps us preserve memoization
characteristics for `makeFetchRequest` so that can work.

I don't find myself having to do this stuff a whole lot, but when I need to it's
nice to know how. Like I said, I'd just use react-query for this kind of thing,
but if I didn't want to, this is how I would actually write this (short of
abstracting it away myself):

```javascript
function App() {
  const [body, setBody] = React.useState()
  const [status, setStatus] = React.useState('idle')

  React.useEffect(() => {
    // no need to do anything if we don't have a body to send
    // so we'll exit early
    if (!body) return

    setStatus('pending')
    const fetchConfig = {
      method: 'POST',
      body,
      headers: {'content-type': 'application/json'},
    }
    fetch('/post', fetchConfig).then(
      () => setStatus('fulfilled'),
      () => setStatus('rejected'),
    )
  }, [body])

  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    // get form input values
    setBody(formInputValues)
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {/* form inputs and other neat stuff... */}
    </form>
  )
}
```

And now I don't need to worry about memoizing anything anyway! Like I said, I
don't need to memoize things super often, but when I do, it's nice to know why
it's needed and what I'm really doing. Hopefully I helped you understand that
too. Good luck!
