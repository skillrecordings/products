excerpt: Why can't React just magically know what to do without a key?
---

If you've used React for a while, you've probably run into this before:

```
index.js:1 Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.

Check the render method of `App`. See https://reactjs.org/link/warning-keys for more information.
    at li
    at App (http://localhost:3000/static/js/30.chunk.js:48:75)
```

You probably know the solution as well. Here's the rule:

**Whenever you're rendering an array of React elements, each one must have a
unique `key` prop.**

Here's the simplest way to reproduce this problem:

```tsx
const items = [
  {id: 'apple', value: '🍎 apple'},
  {id: 'orange', value: '🍊 orange'},
  {id: 'grape', value: '🍇 grape'},
  {id: 'pear', value: '🍐 pear'},
]

function App() {
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <li>{item.value}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

And the solution is pretty simple:

```diff
-         <li>{item.value}</li>
+         <li key={item.id}>{item.value}</li>
```

But like... Why? React doesn't seem to have a problem if I were to write it like
this:

```tsx
function App() {
  return (
    <ul>
      <li>🍎 apple</li>
      <li>🍊 orange</li>
      <li>🍇 grape</li>
      <li>🍐 pear</li>
    </ul>
  )
}
```

It's only a problem if I try to pass the elements as an array. So yeah, why does
React have such a big problem with arrays anyway?

First, if you want to understand what problems can happen without the `key` prop
(and cool things you can do with it), read
[Understanding React's key prop](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/understanding-reacts-key-prop).
In this post, I just want to explain why React can't just magically make things
work without a `key` prop.

I want you to pretend you're React and I'm a React developer building an
application. I'm writing a function component called `App`. You don't get to see
my implementation, all you get is the function which you can pass arguments to and
receive a return value from.

So let's say I give you that function and tell you to render that to the page.
So you call `App` and you get the following React elements back
([learn more about React elements](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/what-is-jsx)):

```js
const element = {
  type: 'ul',
  key: null,
  props: {
    children: [
      {type: 'li', key: null, props: {children: '🍎 apple'}},
      {type: 'li', key: null, props: {children: '🍊 orange'}},
      {type: 'li', key: null, props: {children: '🍇 grape'}},
      {type: 'li', key: null, props: {children: '🍐 pear'}},
    ],
  },
}
```

Ok, first, you're going to warn right? Because the `key` is `null` for all of
those children. 😉 But really, it's fine. You're React and you know how to take
these elements and render them to the page. So you render the `ul` and `li`s to
the page. All's good.

Ok, so now my `App` calls a state updater function and so you know you need to
re-render. So you call `App` again and this time you get some new React
elements:

```javascript
const element = {
  type: 'ul',
  key: null,
  props: {
    children: [
      {type: 'li', key: null, props: {children: '🍎 apple'}},
      {type: 'li', key: null, props: {children: '🍊 orange'}},
      {type: 'li', key: null, props: {children: '🍐 pear'}},
    ],
  },
}
```

Ok, so you do a quick and easy diff here:

```diff
-      {type: 'li', key: null, props: {children: '🍇 grape'}},
```

Oh, cool, so you can just remove the `li` from the page right? Yeah, go ahead
and just unmount it. Sure, do that. Easy-peasy.

Ooh! I need another state update, so you get the next set of React elements:

```javascript
const element = {
  type: 'ul',
  key: null,
  props: {
    children: [
      {type: 'li', key: null, props: {children: '🍊 apple'}},
      {type: 'li', key: null, props: {children: '🍐 pear'}},
    ],
  },
}
```

Now do another diff:

```diff
-       {type: 'li', key: null, props: {children: '🍎 apple'}},
-       {type: 'li', key: null, props: {children: '🍊 orange'}},
+       {type: 'li', key: null, props: {children: '🍊 apple'}},
```

Hmm... Ok, so now... Should remove the `🍎 apple` and `🍊 orange` `li`s and
create a new one with `🍊 apple`? How certain are you that this is what I meant
to do? Maybe what I actually want is to remove the `🍎 apple` and rename
`🍊 orange` to `🍊 apple`... Or maybe I want to remove the `🍊 orange` and
rename `🍎 apple` to `🍊 apple`. Or maybe I want to remove `🍐 pear`, then
rename `🍊 orange` to `🍐 pear`, and then rename `🍎 apple` to `🍊 apple`...

Now you're thinking "Ugh. What the heck? Mr. Dodds. Give me a break."

So, as React, you do your best guess: You pretend the `key` is the `index`. I
mean, you gotta do something right? This is what React actually does.

Interestingly, this means that rather than just unmounting the `🍇 grape` `li`
on that first state update, you actually unmounted `🍐 pear` and updated
`🍇 grape` to say `🍐 pear` 😂. But in a real app, this is no laughing matter.
Unmounting and mounting components has implications on the state and
side-effects of a component (which I describe in more detail in the
aforementioned blog post).

And that also means with this last state update, you unmounted `🍐 pear` again
and updated `🍎 apple` to be `🍊 apple` and `🍊 orange` got updated to say
`🍐 pear`. What a disaster!

This is definitely not the most optimal, but what are you gonna do? You have no
idea what I meant with that element change!

(By the way, I used
[this code](https://codesandbox.io/s/romantic-kalam-mliwb?file=/src/index.js) to
validate what was going on, if you want to poke around).

## In walks the `key` prop...

Phew... Wouldn't it be nice if I had given you some way to track the React
elements from one render to the next so your diff could be more informative.
That way you'd know my intent much better right?

Yeah, let's try that last one, only with `key`s this time:

```javascript
const element = {
  type: 'ul',
  key: null,
  props: {
    children: [
      {type: 'li', key: 'apple', props: {children: '🍎 apple'}},
      {type: 'li', key: 'orange', props: {children: '🍊 orange'}},
      {type: 'li', key: 'pear', props: {children: '🍐 pear'}},
    ],
  },
}
```

Ok, nice, so now here comes the update for you:

```javascript
const element = {
  type: 'ul',
  key: null,
  props: {
    children: [
      {type: 'li', key: 'apple', props: {children: '🍊 apple'}},
      {type: 'li', key: 'pear', props: {children: '🍐 pear'}},
    ],
  },
}
```

Ha! Now you know exactly what to do! You can now do a much more granular diff.
First you notice that the element with the `key` of `'orange'` is gone, so you
know you can remove that from the page. And the element with the `key` of
`'apple'` has new `children` so you can simply update it and move on with life
without worrying about whether you're doing the right thing.

Oh, and for our very first change when we removed the grape `li`, you can
correctly just remove that one now too.

## Conclusion

Now that you've put yourself in React's shoes, hopefully you understand why
React can't just magically know what you're doing with your elements and why you
need to provide a `key` prop. Frankly, this is a limitation in React. It would
be nice to not have this limitation, but not at the expense of React's
simplicity (which is
[what I love most about React](https://epicreact.dev/why-i-love-react)). I hope
this article helped you get an solid understanding of why the `key` prop is
needed when rendering arrays.

I'll leave you with one more thought... With your understanding of the `key`
prop now, can you think of situations where you could use a `key` prop
_outside_ an array? The `key` prop has less to do with arrays, and more to do
with controlling when a component is reused or disposed of and created anew.
Give that some thought 😄
