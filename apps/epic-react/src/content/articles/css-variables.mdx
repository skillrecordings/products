I've been riding the CSS-in-JS train for years (I was even a significant
contributor to the "movement"). It's awesome. I've never been so productive
working with CSS than when I added the power of JavaScript to it.

I'm still a fan of CSS-in-JS, and in recent years, the CSS spec has evolved and
improved a lot and modern browsers have too (unfortunately, Internet Explorer is
NOT a modern browser in this or any context). Often I'd use a `ThemeProvider`
(like those found in emotion), but turns out there aren't a whole lot of
advantages to that kind of component for many use cases and there are several
disadvantages.

Let's look at a simple example of "Dark Mode" and compare differences in API
(developer experience) and performance (user experience). We'll keep the example
simple, and in both the before/after, we'll be using emotion's `styled` utility.
Keep in mind that with the `ThemeProvider` you can consume the values using the
`useTheme` hook, with a styled component, or with the `css` prop. With CSS
Variables, you can get the values in your CSS with `var(--css-variable-name)`
and in your JavaScript using
`getComputedStyle(element).getPropertyValue('--css-variable-name')` (which you
really don't need to do...)

Ok, let's look at some code. Here's an approach to using emotion's
`ThemeProvider`:

```javascript
import * as React from 'react'
import styled from '@emotion/styled'
import {ThemeProvider} from 'emotion-theming'

const themes = {
  light: {
    colors: {
      primary: 'deeppink',
      background: 'white',
    },
  },
  dark: {
    colors: {
      primary: 'lightpink',
      background: 'black',
    },
  },
}

const PrimaryText = styled.div(({theme}) => ({
  padding: 20,
  color: theme.colors.primary,
  backgroundColor: theme.colors.background,
}))

function ThemeToggler({theme, onClick}) {
  const nextTheme = theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'

  return (
    <button onClick={() => onClick(nextTheme)}>
      Change to {nextTheme} mode
    </button>
  )
}

function App() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = React.useState('light')
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={themes[theme]}>
      <PrimaryText>This text is the primary color</PrimaryText>
      <ThemeToggler
        theme={theme}
        onClick={(nextTheme) => setTheme(nextTheme)}
      />
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```

What's cool about this is it's "just JavaScript" so you get all the benefits of
variables etc. But we're not really doing all that much with this other than
passing it around through the ThemeProvider. (To be clear, the way the
ThemeProvider works is it uses React's Context API to make the theme accessible
to all emotion components without having to pass props all over the place).

Let's compare this with the CSS Variables approach. But before we get to that, I
need to mention that there's no "ThemeProvider" for this. Instead, we define the
variables in regular CSS that will get applied based on a `data` attribute we
apply to the `body`. So here's that css file:

```css
body[data-theme='light'] {
  --colors-primary: deeppink;
  --colors-background: white;
}

body[data-theme='dark'] {
  --colors-primary: lightpink;
  --colors-background: black;
}
```

Alright, so with that, here's the implementation of the exact same UI:

```javascript
import * as React from 'react'
import './css-vars.css'
import styled from '@emotion/styled'

const PrimaryText = styled.div({
  padding: 20,
  color: 'var(--colors-primary)',
  backgroundColor: 'var(--colors-background)',
})

function ThemeToggler() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = React.useState('light')
  const nextTheme = theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'

  React.useEffect(() => {
    document.body.dataset.theme = theme
  }, [theme])

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setTheme(nextTheme)}>
      Change to {nextTheme} mode
    </button>
  )
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <PrimaryText>This text is the primary color</PrimaryText>
      <ThemeToggler />
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

Let's first compare what it's like to _use_ these values:

```javascript
// ThemeProvider:
const PrimaryText = styled.div(({theme}) => ({
  padding: 20,
  color: theme.colors.primary,
  backgroundColor: theme.colors.background,
}))

// CSS Variables:
const PrimaryText = styled.div({
  padding: 20,
  color: 'var(--colors-primary)',
  backgroundColor: 'var(--colors-background)',
})
```

There's not really much of a difference from a DX (development experience)
standpoint here. One point for the CSS Variables approach is not having to
create a function that accepts the theme and returning styles (and no need to
even learn about that API).

One point for the `ThemeProvider` approach is if you're using TypeScript you
could get type safety on your theme... But ummm...
[Check this out](https://twitter.com/chochihim/status/1324182272304537600):

```javascript
// src/theme.js
const theme = {
  colors: {
    primary: 'var(--colors-primary)',
    background: 'var(--colors-background)',
  },
}
export {theme}

// anywhere-else.js
import {theme} from 'theme'

const PrimaryText = styled.div({
  padding: 20,
  color: theme.colors.primary,
  backgroundColor: theme.colors.background,
})
```

BOOM. Static typing-friendly.

Either way, that's really the only significant DX difference. Let's consider the
UX (user experience) difference. Why don't you play around with it:

https://codesandbox.io/s/css-variables-vs-themeprovider-df90h

You'll notice there's not really any observable UX difference, and there's not
for this simple example. But why don't you try this with me:

1. pop open the React DevTools Profiler
2. Start a profiling session (click the little circle)
3. Click the toggle button for each
4. Stop the profiling session
5. Compare the two commits

Here's what I see:

**ThemeProvider:**

![Profiling session showing everything rendered](/articles-images/css-variables/theme-provider.png)

**CSS Variables:**

![Profiling session showing only one component rendered](/articles-images/css-variables/css-vars.png)

I don't want you to get hung up on the number of milliseconds to rerender. This
isn't a controlled benchmark (we're in React's dev mode for one thing). The
thing I want you to consider is how many components needed to re-render for this
change. Let's consider the `ThemeProvider` approach first. The main reason for
this is the way we've structured our state
([we could restructure things](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/optimize-react-re-renders)
and improve it a little bit). But even if we restructured things, when the theme
changes, _every_ emotion component needs to be re-rendered to account for the
theme change.

Turning to the CSS Variables approach, you'll notice the only component that
re-rendered was our `ThemeToggler` component responsible for updating the
`body`. And yet the user experience works perfectly! This is the magic behind
CSS variables. With the `ThemeProvider` approach, we have to update the styles
of every component, and then the browser paints those updates. But with the CSS
Variables approach, we update the styles to a single component (the `body`) and
then the browser paints those updates. The browser paint should theoretically
take the same amount of work on the part of the browser, so the only difference
is how much work we're making the browser do to have React re-render all our
components and get emotion to update the styles of every component.

This _can_ have negative performance implications as your app grows. Considering
the DX isn't objectively better or worse either way, but the UX is quite
possibly better with CSS Variables, I feel comfortable recommending CSS
Variables over using Context to share a theme like this.

Oh, and consider also that CSS Variables are part of the browser spec and the
ThemeProvider isn't. That's another solid point for CSS Variables ðŸ˜‰

This is one standard I'd suggest you embrace.

One last piece of nuance here. What if you not only want to change styles but
_also_ want to change component implementations based on the theme? In this
case...
[YOU CAN DO BOTH](https://twitter.com/sebmarkbage/status/1324097255557767173)!
The benefit of doing this is the only components that need to consume the
context value are those that need to render differently based on the theme
(which is likely a small subset). Most components can use the css variables for
styling purposes only, so you'll still get the aforementioned benefits. If you
don't _need_ components to render differently based on the theme then I wouldn't
bother with this, but if you do, then it's pretty simple to do. There are
several ways to accomplish this, I've done one implementation in
[the codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/css-variables-vs-themeprovider-df90h?file=/src/both/index.js).
Enjoy exploring that.

CSS variables (custom properties) are awesome. Give them a look. Good luck!
