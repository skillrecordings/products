excerpt: How to improve your custom hook APIs with a simple pattern

In my post
["How React Uses Closures to Avoid Bugs"](https://epicreact.dev/how-react-uses-closures-to-avoid-bugs)
I explain some of the trade-offs React made when they switched from classes and
lifecycles to functions and hooks. I want to dig a little deeper on this topic.

In that post, I share the following example:

```javascript
function useDebounce(callback, delay) {
  const callbackRef = React.useRef(callback)

  React.useLayoutEffect(() => {
    callbackRef.current = callback
  })

  return React.useMemo(
    () => debounce((...args) => callbackRef.current(...args), delay),
    [delay],
  )
}
```

I want to talk a bit about this pattern that my friend
[Yago](https://twitter.com/yagopereiraaz) (who created the original hook) likes
to call "The Latest Ref Pattern."

The pattern itself is pretty simple. Here's the part that's the pattern:

```javascript
const callbackRef = React.useRef(callback)

React.useLayoutEffect(() => {
  callbackRef.current = callback
})
```

That's it. That's the pattern.

So why would you want to do this? Well, let's think about when you use `useRef`.
You use `useRef` whenever you want to keep track of a value, but not trigger a
re-render when you update it. So in our case, we're trying to keep track of
`callback`. The reason for this, is we want to make sure that we're always
calling the latest version of the `callback` rather than one from an old render.

But why don't we use `useState` instead? Could we keep track of this latest
callback value in an actual state value? We don't want to use `useState` because
we don't need to trigger a component re-render when we update to the latest
value. In fact, in our case if we tried, we'd trigger an infinite loop (go
ahead, try it üòà).

And because we don't need or want a re-render when we update the `callback` to
the latest value, it means we also don't need to (and really shouldn't) include
it in a dependency array for `useEffect`, `useCallback`, or in our case
`useMemo`. This is an important point, so I want to dive into it a bit.

It's really important that you follow the
`eslint-plugin-react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` rule and always include all
dependencies. But you _should_ skip the `current` value of a ref. So don't ever
do this:

```javascript
// ‚ùå don't ever do this
React.useEffect(() => {}, [ref.current])
```

This is because updating a ref doesn't trigger a re-render anyway, so React
can't call the effect callback or update memoized values when the ref is
updated. So if you include `ref.current` in the dependency array, you'll get
surprising behavior that's difficult to debug. As a side-note, because the `ref`
itself is a stable object, it doesn't make a difference if you include the `ref`
object itself in your dependency array:

```javascript
// ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è doesn't make a difference whether you include the ref or not.
React.useEffect(() => {}, [ref])
```

You can run into some serious bugs if you don't include all your non-ref deps
though, so just please, don't ignore
[the linting rule](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) for
this.

## Conclusion

Before using "the latest ref pattern" everywhere, I suggest you get a good
understanding for what it is you're side-stepping, so if you haven't already,
give
["How React Uses Closures to Avoid Bugs"](https://epicreact.dev/how-react-uses-closures-to-avoid-bugs)
a read-through. That'll help you get a better idea of when it can be useful to
use this particular pattern. I'd love to hear situations when you find this
pattern useful.
