I feel way more confident in my React abilities now. The workshops cover almost everything you need to know in React. Nowadays whenever I find myself unfamiliar with a concept in React, I just refer back to the notes and exercises. The other day, I was looking at some production level React code that I have never seen before and I did not feel overwhelmed at all.',

After, I feel like a superhero and have super powers with React. I've been able to solve some harder problems with simpler solutions. I'm working on an internal tool for the company I work for and I've been able to create some incredible advanced functionality with the added knowledge from Kent's course.",
