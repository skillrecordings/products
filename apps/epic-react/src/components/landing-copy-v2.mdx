{<p className="text-center">The most in-demand JavaScript framework just got a massive upgrade!</p>}

<React19FeaturesStack />

There are 3 huge paradigm shifts that'll change your code (and maybe your life):

1. **React Suspense and Transitions:** cut out the kludges & take complete control over how you you load data, sync & async, for the sleekest user experience
2. **Form and Server Actions:** ditch useEffect hacks forever (finally!) while delivering the exact data entry experience you want
3. **'use client' and 'use server':** write server and client code in harmony, eliminating awkward transitions

Once you master the React 19 way, you'll be able to transform your codebase:

<CodebaseTransformation />

Your code will be better. Your coding experience will be better. React 19 is more fun to use because it finally gives you the complete set of tools you need to make a highly interactive, powerful web application without compromise.

And if you're new to the React ecosystem? You get to start fresh with the best React ever. Great timing!

It's a lot to learn. But it's worth it.

Now — experienced or newbie alike — you face a critical question:

**How will you master React 19?**

## Hi there, I'm Kent C. Dodds and I've taught React to over 30,000 people

My first Epic React course has helped so many people start new careers in React, and grow their existing ones. But I knew it could be even better… so when I set out to create all-new material for React 19, I also radically redesigned the entire experience.

And I'll tell you all about that in a little bit.

But first, there's something you should know about the practice of learning React, regardless of when, where, or how you want to learn it.

Over the past 10 years, I've learned a lot about learning.

And the biggest lesson of all?

### Not all learning is created equal.

You ever hear that old saying, It's not what you know, it's who you know?

We need an updated version for developers: It's not what you know, it's how you know. How you learn can influence the entire course of your career.

And here's the real rub:

### The way most people learn React will actively sabotage your future progress.

React is complex. It's got a lot of parts. Nobody wants to sit and read the docs for every single one of them before doing something. We all want to skip straight to the fun part — using all these tools, together, right away — to make things.

Making things feels like momentum.

But it's a trick.

The thing that truly separates experts from everyone else isn't special, advanced knowledge. It's total mastery of the basics. It's understanding the components. It's knowing how every part of the process works together in harmony to create the whole. It's being able to step outside the box of what you've done before and approach each new problem fresh using all the tools at your disposal.

That's what creates true confidence.

But when you go "fast" by rushing to the end result, dutifully re-typing code you don't yet understand, you speed past the very thing that will help you most. You miss the fundamentals you'll need every day in your career: planning, designing, debugging, maintaining, scaling. You cheat yourself out of future growth. You undermine your own confidence.

### Here's how you become an _expert_

Based on observation, experiments, study, hundreds of hours of live teaching, and feedback from tens of thousands using my self-guided courses…

**Here's the path to true expertise:**

- Master one concept at a time
- Start with the simplest version possible
- Add complexity incrementally, step by step, with each exercise building directly on the previous
- Write practice code, check your work against best practices, get feedback
- Practice taking direction, advice, even sharing code with collaborators
- Don't skip anything (even if it's "easy" or "obvious")

It really is that simple! Although "simple" isn't the same thing as "easy."

But if you're willing to commit, learning the right way will pay dividends forever.

You'll be the expert.

And you can do it with Epic React 2.0.

{<h2 className="text-center">Epic React 2.0 will take you from "what's JSX?" to developing a complete, professional-grade, scalable application in a teamwork environment.</h2>}

When you enroll in Epic React 2.0, you'll get instant access to **7 workshops with 240 bite-sized lessons — all new, all React 19, and 100% TypeScript.** All you have to do is sign up, download, and get started coding on your very first exercise in just 10 minutes.

You'll start at the very beginning: with a DOM node.

You'll learn every part of React 19 — all the classic stuff, and all the new — separately and in concert.

Each new lesson will build on the one you did before.

{/* By the end, you'll develop @TODOFinalAppProjects. */}

{/* Along the way, you'll learn professional coding practices, like @TODO. */}

You'll even practice developing React in a teamwork environment with simulated coworkers.

And you don't have to do it alone: when you're learning, you'll see the shining faces of fellow students working on that same lesson… and when you enroll in the Pro package, you'll get lifetime access to our Epic React Discord.

So, whether you're an intermediate dev looking to learn React for the first time (lucky you!)…

…or an experienced React developer looking to level up…

If you've been looking for your pathway to true React mastery? You've found it.

Let's take a tour.
