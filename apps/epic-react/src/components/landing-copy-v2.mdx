{<h2 className="mx-auto max-w-sm text-balance text-center">Are you ready for the React 19 revolution?</h2>}
{<p className="text-center">The most in-demand JavaScript framework just got a massive upgrade!</p>}

<React19FeaturesStack />

{props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `You're not new to React, but with React 19 there` : 'There'} are 3 huge paradigm shifts that'll change your code (and maybe your life):

1. **React Suspense and Transitions:** cut out the kludges & take complete control over how you load data, sync & async, for the sleekest user experience
2. **Form and Server Actions:** ditch useEffect hacks forever (finally!) while delivering the exact data entry experience you want for SSR, SSG, and SPA apps
3. **'use client' and 'use server':** write server and client code in harmony, eliminating awkward transitions

Once you master the React 19 way, you'll be able to transform your codebase:

<CodebaseTransformation />

Your code will be better. Your coding experience will be better. React 19 is more fun to use because it finally gives you the complete set of tools you need to make a highly interactive, powerful web application without compromise.

And if you're new to the React ecosystem? You get to start fresh with the best React ever. Great timing!

It's a lot to learn. But it's worth it.

Now — experienced or newbie alike — you face a critical question:

**How will you master React 19?**

## {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `I've taught React to over 30,000 people` : `Hi there, I'm Kent C. Dodds and I've taught React to over 30,000 people`}

<AboutKent>
  {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `Epic React v1` : `My first Epic React course`} has
  helped so many people start new careers in React, and grow their existing
  ones. But I knew it could be even better… so when I set out to create all-new
  material for React 19, I also radically redesigned the entire experience.

  And I'll tell you all about that in a little bit.

  But first, there's something you should know about the practice of learning
  React, regardless of when, where, or how you want to learn it.

  Over the past 10 years, I've learned a lot about learning.

  And the biggest lesson of all?
</AboutKent>

### Not all learning is created equal.

You ever hear that old saying, It's not what you know, it's who you know?

We need an updated version for developers: _It's not what you know, it's how you know_. How you learn can influence the entire course of your career.

And here's the real rub:

### The way most people learn React will actively sabotage your future progress.

React is complex. It's got a lot of parts. Nobody wants to sit and read the docs for every single one of them before doing something. We all want to skip straight to the fun part — using all these tools, together, right away — to make things.

Making things feels like momentum.

But it's a trick.

The thing that truly separates experts from everyone else isn't special, advanced knowledge. It's total mastery of the basics. It's understanding the components. It's knowing how every part of the process works together in harmony to create the whole. It's being able to step outside the box of what you've done before and approach each new problem fresh using all the tools at your disposal.

That's what creates true confidence.

But when you go "fast" by rushing to the end result, dutifully re-typing code you don't yet understand, you speed past the very thing that will help you most. You miss the fundamentals you'll need every day in your career: planning, designing, debugging, maintaining, scaling. You cheat yourself out of future growth. You undermine your own confidence.

Luckily there's a better way.

### Here's how you become an _expert_

Based on observation, experiments, study, hundreds of hours of live teaching, and feedback from tens of thousands using my self-guided courses…

**This is the path to true expertise:**

- Master one concept at a time
- Start with the simplest version possible
- Add complexity incrementally, step by step, with each exercise building directly on the previous
- Write practice code, check your work against best practices, get feedback
- Practice taking direction, advice, even sharing code with collaborators
- Don't skip anything (even if it's "easy" or "obvious")

It really is that simple! Although "simple" isn't the same thing as "easy."

But if you're willing to commit, learning the right way will pay dividends forever.

You'll be the expert.

And you can do it with {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `Epic React v2` : `Epic React`}.

{<h2 className="!-mt-10 !pt-7 text-center !pb-5">{props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `Epic React v2` : `Epic React`} will take you from "what's JSX?" to developing a complete, professional-grade, scalable application in a teamwork environment.</h2>}

{props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `When you upgrade to Epic React v2` : `When you enroll in Epic React`}, you'll get instant access to **7 workshops with 240 bite-sized lessons — all new, all React 19, and 100% TypeScript.** All you have to do is {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `sign in` : `sign up`} and get started coding your very first exercise.

<p>{props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `You'll start by reviewing the fundamentals: a DOM node.` : `You'll start at the very beginning: with a DOM node.`}</p>

You'll {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `learn and review` : `learn`} every part of React 19 — all the classic stuff, and all the new — separately and in concert.

Each new lesson will build on the one you did before.

{/* By the end, you'll develop @TODOFinalAppProjects. */}
{/* Projects: Calculator, Forms, Blog Search, Animated Tilt, Tic Tac Toe, Counter, Performant Globe, Searchable List of Cities, RSC Shipyard */}

<Projects />

By the end, you'll develop projects such as a blog search, animated tilt, tic-tac-toe, new user form, performant globe, calculator, counter, searchable list of cities, and RSC Shipyard.

### Along the way, you'll {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `reinforce` : `learn`} professional coding practices

You'll **master form handling**, one of the trickiest (and most powerful) parts of interactive web development.

You'll learn how to **develop for performance**, and optimize your existing code. (Bonus: these same techniques apply to non-React apps, too!)

You'll learn how to **use AI coding assistants** for a massive productivity boost. I use mine in every Epic React video lesson. (They don't do the work for you, of course, but they sure can help!)

All while you practice developing React 19 apps within your virtual team. Your simulated guides, Peter the Project Manager and Kellie the Coworker, set specifications, provide suggestions and even code for you to build on, (almost) just like real life.

**And you don't have to do it alone**: every time you sit down to learn, you'll see the shining faces of your fellow students working on that same exact lesson at the same exact time… and you'll get lifetime access to our Epic React Discord channels.

So, whether you're an intermediate dev looking to {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `review the fundamentals` : `learn React for the first time (lucky you!)`}…

…or an experienced React developer looking to {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `learn whats new in React 19` : `level up`}…

### If you've been looking for a path to true React 19 mastery? You've found it with {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `Epic React v2` : `Epic React`}.

Let's take a {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `tour to see what's in the brand-new upgraded Epic React v2!` : `tour!`}


<IntroTourVideo />

### You are going to love learning with {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `Epic React v2 more than ever.` : `Epic React.`}

A lot of programming courses are, when you get right down to it, a pile of videos and written tutorials with a table of contents. The material just kinda… sits there. When it comes to actually learning, all the work is left to you.

_You_ have to track where you left off.

_You_ have to set up your dev environment for each exercise.

_You_ have to manually check your work, flipping between a stack of tabs to compare. That's a lot of cognitive overhead!

The worst part is, all that extra work doesn't do anything for _you_ (except drive procrastination).

That's exactly why I took my years of teaching — and feedback from tens of thousands of students — and designed a custom, interactive workshop experience for you.

### Because it's not just what you learn, it's how you learn.

When you learn with {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `Epic React v2` : `Epic React`}, you'll be able to sit down and start learning right away, whether it's your first day or your final lesson.

It's so much more fun and motivating to learn when…

* you can always pick up exactly where you left off because {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `Epic React v2` : `Epic React`} tracks your progress for you, and automatically opens to your latest lesson
* you can jump right into the code because, with a click of a button, {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `Epic React v2` : `Epic React`} sets up a fresh development playground for you (for your favorite IDE!)
* you can maximize your keyboard time, because every lesson is short, sweet, and actionable
* you can check your work instantly (one click!) with diffs for ideal solutions and built-in tests
* you can trust an expert teacher (me!) to handle pacing and breaks for you (plus bonus dad jokes)
* you can get help when you're stuck, because you're part of a global community all working towards the same goal

In other words, when you can use 100% of your brain to do what it does best: learn.

That's the experience you get with {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `Epic React v2` : `Epic React`}.

## What it's like to learn with {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `the all new, upgraded Epic React v2` : `Epic React`}

Epic React {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `v2 is divided into 7 complete, new` : `is divided into 7 complete`}, self-paced interactive workshops, which run as React apps on your local dev machine.

Here's what it's like, from your perspective as a learner:

1. To get started, you simply `git clone` the workshop you want. .
2. Just a few clicks and you'll be  watching  that workshop's intro  on `localhost`.
3. After the short & sweet lesson, you're ready to code! Click set as playground, and you can open your freshly generated project files in your favorite IDE.

While you hammer away at your exercise, {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `Epic React v2` : `Epic React`} automatically update with your code in progress… and so will the  automatic full-code diff comparing your code with my suggested solution.

And, for most exercises, you can run tests against your code with a single click. ou’ll also get another tab that provides tests for most exercises.

Once you've finished your exercise, you can watch a video on how and why I wrote the solution.

Then you click Next!

Your exercise will be marked as completed, and you'll be moved forward to a new lesson, new exercise, new `set as playground`.

### At any time, in any lesson, you can reach out to the Epic Discord for help (or simply fellow feeling).

And we don't want you burning out, so every few lessons you'll be encouraged to take a break! Stretch, walk, have a hot beverage, letting the lessons sink in. I'll even tell you a little Dad joke (groaning is good for the brain).

You're supported at every step and in every way. So you can put all your time and energy into excelling at React 19.


## Why your learning sticks with {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `Epic React v2` : `Epic React`}

Have you ever left a lesson — text, video, even in-person — feeling buoyant and confident, but a week later, when you try to apply it in the real world, it's all foggy and vague?

There are two reasons for this:

- The learning wasn't active
- The learning wasn't connected to your real life

The first one's obvious: **Just watching someone else code won't teach you to code effectively; you need to do it yourself**.

The second problem is all about context: When you practice a new skill in a clean-room environment, and then try to apply it in the real, messy, complicated world… well, things will be missing. You won't get the full value of your practice.

That's why I designed {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `the upgraded Epic React v2` : `Epic React`} to ensure your learning is fun, effective, and sticky:

✅ Learn actively, not passively — you'll get lots of keyboard time to form new pathways in your brain

✅ Learn real-world skills in context — you'll get your directions from a virtual project manager, you'll get tips from helpful teammates, and you'll even get helped out by a wonderful coworker who provides code for you to work with, all while you build projects that grow and evolve just like they do in the real world

Bottom line: _Your new React skills will stick because you’ll practice the job of a React developer while you learn React 19 concepts inside and out._

  production-ready React applications.

## You can't get this level of training anywhere else at any price.

Live workshops can be effective, but they're not easy. Each workshop costs hundreds (or thousands) of dollars apiece — not to mention the travel costs — and chomps days or even weeks out of your life.

Plus there's the intensity (exhausting) and pressure (enormous).

**The all-new {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `is 7 complete
brand-new updated workshops` : `is 7 complete
workshops`} in one, with a guided, interactive, contextual experience you won't get anywhere else.** You'll learn everything in your own time, at your own pace. And you can do it all in your pajamas in your own home, or even at the office with your whole team.

All for less than the cost of a cheap flight and mid-range hotel for a single night in a mid-tier city.

<p>{props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `Epic React v2` : `Epic React`} is a bargain you
  can't afford to miss!</p>
