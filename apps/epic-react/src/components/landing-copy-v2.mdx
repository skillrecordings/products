{<h2 className="mx-auto max-w-sm text-balance text-center">Are you ready for the React 19 revolution?</h2>}
{<p className="text-center">The most in-demand JavaScript framework just got a massive upgrade!</p>}

<React19FeaturesStack />

There are 3 huge paradigm shifts that'll change your code (and maybe your life):

1. **React Suspense and Transitions:** cut out the kludges & take complete control over how you you load data, sync & async, for the sleekest user experience
2. **Form and Server Actions:** ditch useEffect hacks forever (finally!) while delivering the exact data entry experience you want
3. **'use client' and 'use server':** write server and client code in harmony, eliminating awkward transitions

Once you master the React 19 way, you'll be able to transform your codebase:

<CodebaseTransformation />

Your code will be better. Your coding experience will be better. React 19 is more fun to use because it finally gives you the complete set of tools you need to make a highly interactive, powerful web application without compromise.

And if you're new to the React ecosystem? You get to start fresh with the best React ever. Great timing!

It's a lot to learn. But it's worth it.

Now — experienced or newbie alike — you face a critical question:

**How will you master React 19?**

## Hi there, I'm Kent C. Dodds and I've taught React to over 30,000 people

My first Epic React course has helped so many people start new careers in React, and grow their existing ones. But I knew it could be even better… so when I set out to create all-new material for React 19, I also radically redesigned the entire experience.

And I'll tell you all about that in a little bit.

But first, there's something you should know about the practice of learning React, regardless of when, where, or how you want to learn it.

Over the past 10 years, I've learned a lot about learning.

And the biggest lesson of all?

### Not all learning is created equal.

You ever hear that old saying, It's not what you know, it's who you know?

We need an updated version for developers: It's not what you know, it's how you know. How you learn can influence the entire course of your career.

And here's the real rub:

### The way most people learn React will actively sabotage your future progress.

React is complex. It's got a lot of parts. Nobody wants to sit and read the docs for every single one of them before doing something. We all want to skip straight to the fun part — using all these tools, together, right away — to make things.

Making things feels like momentum.

But it's a trick.

The thing that truly separates experts from everyone else isn't special, advanced knowledge. It's total mastery of the basics. It's understanding the components. It's knowing how every part of the process works together in harmony to create the whole. It's being able to step outside the box of what you've done before and approach each new problem fresh using all the tools at your disposal.

That's what creates true confidence.

But when you go "fast" by rushing to the end result, dutifully re-typing code you don't yet understand, you speed past the very thing that will help you most. You miss the fundamentals you'll need every day in your career: planning, designing, debugging, maintaining, scaling. You cheat yourself out of future growth. You undermine your own confidence.

### Here's how you become an _expert_

Based on observation, experiments, study, hundreds of hours of live teaching, and feedback from tens of thousands using my self-guided courses…

**Here's the path to true expertise:**

- Master one concept at a time
- Start with the simplest version possible
- Add complexity incrementally, step by step, with each exercise building directly on the previous
- Write practice code, check your work against best practices, get feedback
- Practice taking direction, advice, even sharing code with collaborators
- Don't skip anything (even if it's "easy" or "obvious")

It really is that simple! Although "simple" isn't the same thing as "easy."

But if you're willing to commit, learning the right way will pay dividends forever.

You'll be the expert.

And you can do it with Epic React 2.0.

{<h2 className="!-mt-10 !pt-0 text-center !pb-10">Epic React 2.0 will take you from "what's JSX?" to developing a complete, professional-grade, scalable application in a teamwork environment.</h2>}

When you enroll in Epic React 2.0, you'll get instant access to **7 workshops with 240 bite-sized lessons — all new, all React 19, and 100% TypeScript.** All you have to do is sign up and get started coding on your very first exercise in just 10 minutes.

You'll start at the very beginning: with a DOM node.

You'll learn every part of React 19 — all the classic stuff, and all the new — separately and in concert.

Each new lesson will build on the one you did before.

{/* By the end, you'll develop @TODOFinalAppProjects. */}

{/* Along the way, you'll learn professional coding practices, like @TODO. */}

You'll even practice developing React in a teamwork environment with simulated coworkers.

And you don't have to do it alone: when you're learning, you'll see the shining faces of fellow students working on that same lesson… and when you enroll in the Pro package, you'll get lifetime access to our Epic React Discord.

So, whether you're an intermediate dev looking to learn React for the first time (lucky you!)…

…or an experienced React developer looking to level up…

If you've been looking for your pathway to true React mastery? You've found it.

Let's take a tour.

### Why you'll love learning with Epic React 2.0 (it's different (and better))

Epic React was designed from the ground up to help you build expertise and master React 19 quickly and efficiently. From the basics to the most advanced React features, the learning experience is fun and rewarding.

You’ve got limited time and energy which is why Epic React is focused on quick wins and maximizing your time at the keyboard coding and not watching endless boring videos.

The exercises that you’ll be solving are based on real-world React and will challenge you at every step. But you’ll be fully supported with before and after code diffs and tests that let you know with confidence that your expertise is growing as you put in the work.

**With Epic React, you’re never alone.**

The workshop app has a shared presence feature so you’ll be working with your peers, and the very active Epic Discord server is always a click away if you get stuck, have questions, or want to share what you’ve built.

### Here’s how it works

Epic React is divided into 7 complete self-paced workshops. The workshops have an introduction, and are further divided into sections that contain the exercises that you will be working on (and the occasional dad joke break).

Instead of watching videos on the Epic React website, you’ll clone the workshop app for each individual workshop when you are ready to work on it. With just a few clicks you’ll be up and running and watching the intro video for the workshop through the app on your `localhost`.

For the actual exercises you’ll be working in your IDE of choice, coding as you would on the job. As you make changes for your solution to the exercises, the workshop app will update providing you with a full code diff from your solution and the suggested solutions. You’ll also get another tab that provides tests for most exercises, so you can run those tests with confidence that your solution worked.

Finally, you can watch Kent code the solution and talk about the decision making process that went into solving it.

### Get your hands on that keyboard ASAP with Epic React

Getting started is always the hardest part of learning something new, and React is no exception. With Epic React, you can get over that hump quickly and start learning immediately.
It’s crucial to get your fingers on the keyboard with a proper development environment setup, and Epic React takes the struggle out of getting started by making the “Hello World” easy and fun.

Increasing your time at the keyboard makes sure you aren’t passively learning while an instructor drones on. Instead you’ll be actively doing the job of a React developer as you learn the concepts that you need inside and out.

### Practice professional skills

With Epic React you’ll be working on practical problem-solving skills in the same way you do as a professional developer. These workshops simulate a real-world team environment and give you the feel of what it’s like to ship React apps in production.

## Here's everything you'll learn & achieve…

Epic React is specifically designed for experienced developers who want to learn React 19 as quickly and efficiently as possible. Whether you’re totally new to React or have used React for awhile but want to develop true mastery, Epic React was tailored for you.

- React Suspense and Transitions
- Forms and Server Actions
- `use server` and `use client`

Your React components will be fresh, functional, elegant, and more reusable than ever before.
