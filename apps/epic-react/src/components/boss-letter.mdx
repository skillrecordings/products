  Dear Boss,

  We've been working extremely hard to create high-quality, performant,
  well-tested React apps that scale to the needs of our users. This is
  challenging to accomplish on a team of our size and with team members that
  have various backgrounds, context, and understanding of how to build web
  applications and use our tools effectively.

  There are many reasons for this:

  - React has changed over the last few years and so have the patterns.
  - Everybody has learned React from different sources of varied quality.
  - Our app has grown and changed and the patterns have started to drift.
  - We've had developers come and go causing our shared group knowledge to
  change accordingly.

  As a team, we want to be as effective as possible and bring ever increasing
  value to our users and the business. It's important to us to develop
  high-quality applications that perform well and aren't riddled with bugs.

  That's our job!

  That's why we are asking for licenses to
  [https://EpicReact.dev](https://epicreact.dev).

  Epic React is a complete end-to-end series of self-paced workshops from Kent
  C. Dodds. Every module in Epic React is produced from multiple live in person
  events and have been used to learn React by 30,000+ developers.

  By using Epic React the team will be able to have **common shared knowledge
  about how to build React apps with modern best practices**, which we feel
  could save the business money, increase revenue, and bring our users a better
  overall experience using our app.

  Kent C. Dodds has taught 10s of thousands of people how to effectively use
  React and even maintains some of the open source tools that we use in our app.

  We really need this.

  If you'd like to support our skills and knowledge as developers to increase
  the quality of the applications we write for you and our users, please click
  here to visit Epic React and purchase a team license for us:
  [https://EpicReact.dev/buy](https://epicreact.dev/buy).

  Kent even offers quantity discounts so we can save money by providing licenses
  for the entire team.

  If you've got questions, please reply. We'd love to talk about this more.
  Otherwise, we look forward to receiving our link to start learning from Epic
  React as soon as possible.

  Thanks!

  \- your team
