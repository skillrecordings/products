Building React applications demands that you make expert decisions before you write the first line of code.

You're responsible for building a cohesive, maintainable code-base that will help your team succeed and build a React application that serves your customers' needs.

You're faced with hundreds of decisions.

If you don't choose correctly users will suffer.

**Your team will suffer.**

You'll be **stuck with your early bad decisions** for the next 5 years at a minimum.

## React is the smart choice for most web development projects in 2023

React provides an "assembly-level" set of tools without a lot of guidance on how to turn those tools into an application that scales.

That's what makes React awesome.

But React's flexibility is a double-edged sword.

It's up to you and your team to decide how your application will be architected and maintained over time.

To make those decisions, you need expertise.

**You need experience.**

This is where the official React documentation cuts you short.

### You are left piecing together components like a bucket of Lego spilled on the floor.

You need to build applications that scale.

âœ… Well-tested.

âœ… Well-architected.

**You don't have time for trial and error.**

You have to get it right.

## One of the biggest challenges with learning React is the vast sea of low-grade internet learning content.

You're going to spend countless hours wading through out-of-date, low-effort, inconsistent, and often **wrong** blog posts, YouTube videos, and courses across the internet trying to understand how to build React applications that scale.

Books are out of date.

Articles are filled with bad advice.

Screencasts are old, stale, and too time-consuming to watch while not providing real practice.

Youtube channels are thinly veiled content-marketing schemes meant to harvest cash from your wallet without caring about you or your career. ðŸ˜¬

## There has to be a better way.

What if you had a resource for you and your team that taught **consistent fundamentals of React component development** as well as a well defined, production-proven, enterprise-grade architecture for building applications that scale?

Wouldn't it be great to confidently develop React applications with a solid foundation?

Would you like to have a coherent strategy and remove the indecision that comes with building a new React application from scratch?
