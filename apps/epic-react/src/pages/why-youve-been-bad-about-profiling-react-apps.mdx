When was the last time you tried your app out on the kinds of devices your end
users are using? If you haven't, have you at least tried to simulate the kind of
performance characteristics of your users on low-end devices?

Or are you working on a product that only users with high-end devices use?
You've got metrics to prove that only high-end device users are using your app
do you? Hmmm... Have you considered that the reason low-end device users aren't
using your app because when they show up to your app they never come back
because performance is bad? That might make an impact on your metrics a bit 😅

If you _have_ profiled your app, are you sure you're doing it correctly?

## The example

Check this out:

![DevTools flamegraph with a few red spots](/articles-images/why-youve-been-bad-about-profiling-react-apps/dev-no-throttle.png)

If you don't recognize where that's coming from, it's a screenshot of
[the Chrome DevTool's Performance tab](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference).

Here's the interaction that I'm doing that's creating that flamegraph:

![A form with the label "Find a city" and the word "salt" is typed into an input with cities being filtered in a combobox below](/articles-images/why-youve-been-bad-about-profiling-react-apps/typing-salt.gif)

From that flamegraph, we can see that there are maybe two spots that could use
some optimization. But oh, what's that? It says "CPU: No throttling." Remember
that our users might not have the high speed devices that we use to create our
applications. If we want to make sure our apps work for users with less powerful
machines, then we should at least simulate those kinds of machines. So let's
change that to throttle our CPU by 6x:

![DevTools flamegraph with solid red spots](/articles-images/why-youve-been-bad-about-profiling-react-apps/dev-throttle.png)

Yikes!!! Look at those red lines! That's some slow janky stuff there folks. How
in the world could users possibly use this app with anything but a souped up
beast of a machine! React must be SO SLOW!

No hold on. Take a step back. Take a deep breath. Step away from the window and
put your laptop down. It's really important that I tell you something about
React performance.

You know all those helpful warnings that React gives you when you do something
wrong? Stuff like:

```
Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined.
```

This is one of the things that I loved about React when I started using it. I
was so used to things silently failing and having to dig around to figure out
what I did wrong.

Turns out, React has to do quite a bit of extra work to make that magic happen.
That doesn't come for free. In fact, it's actually pretty impactful. But we
don't need these in production, so our end-user should never run that extra
code. Luckily, React has been built with this in mind and the process to get rid
of this extra code is
[well documented](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html).

So let's try that:

![Flamegraph with only one red line](/articles-images/why-youve-been-bad-about-profiling-react-apps/prod-no-throttle.png)

Phew! That's much better! We have a much better idea of what is actually slow.
But oh, let's not forget to throttle things to simulate our lower-end device
user's experience:

![Flamegraph with a few red lines](/articles-images/why-youve-been-bad-about-profiling-react-apps/prod-throttle.png)

Ok, so it looks like we've got a few things to improve for our lower-end device
users.

## Profile the user's actual experience

If you're not measuring what your user's actual experience is like, then you
could spend all your time chasing the optimization of red herring distractions
and miss the actual interactions that cause your users grief.

Actually profiling your app's performance is just a first step, properly
profiling it is the next. But hold up... I'm just simulating the user's
experience on my own device. So I'm only _close_ to the user's experience, but
do I really know for sure what it's like for users? And what about regressions?
Do you expect me to do that every time I make a code change? No thank you.

This is why production performance monitoring is so important. We should keep
track of how things are performing for users. Luckily React also exposes the
ability to do this, so we can batch up information about every mount and update
of components as the user's using them and we can send that information off to
our backend, like this:

![A request payload showing component mounts and updates](/articles-images/why-youve-been-bad-about-profiling-react-apps/profile.png)

Then we can store that in a time-series database, and get alerts and graphs
based on that. Companies like Facebook enable this for a fraction of their users
and they can automatically rollback changes if they result in performance
problems.

## Conclusion

Buttery-smooth performance is one of the things users expect from our apps and
if we don't have that, they lose trust in our app. They may endure the janky
experience, or they may abandon it altogether. It's often not the kind of thing
user's will complain about, so if you're not testing and monitoring it, then you
may never know that you're missing out on making your app available to those
users at all. And if you don't do that properly, then you can spend your days
optimizing the wrong things and in the wrong ways.

And yes, I've got lots to teach you about in
[EpicReact.Dev](https://epicreact.dev).

P.S. Have you ever tried to pop open the React Profiler tab in production and
seen this:

![React DevTools with the message: Profiling not supported.](/articles-images/why-youve-been-bad-about-profiling-react-apps/profile-missing-prod.png)

In EpicReact.Dev, I'll show you how to use the Profiler tab in production:
