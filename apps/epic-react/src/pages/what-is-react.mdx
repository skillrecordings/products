React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces and managing user
interactions. React is used primarily for building web applications in browsers,
but the component model is so powerful that it can be used to create native
mobile and desktop applications, images, PDFs, terminal applications, and much
more.

As a result of React’s success with the component-based model of interface
composition, many other UI libraries and frameworks have adopted this approach
with their own flare. However, React has been _(by a large margin)_ **the
dominant way** to build user interfaces for many years now and will likely
remain that way as long as you or I continue to develop software on the web.

Let’s go a little deeper and look at the pieces that make up React.

## React’s core building block

The foundational component of user interfaces built with React are elements:

```tsx
import { createElement } from 'react'

const element = createElement(
	'button',
	{ onClick: () => console.log('clicked!') },
	'Click me!',
)
```

If we inspect the element that React’s created, it looks like this:

```tsx
{
  "$$typeof": Symbol(react.element),
  "type": "button",
  "key": null,
  "ref": null,
  "props": {
    "onClick": () => console.log('clicked!'),
    "children": "Click me!"
  },
  "_owner": null,
  "_store": {}
}
```

This object (which I call a “UI descriptor”) is used to generated UI that’s
native to the environment it’s rendered in. In our case we want to generate UI
for the browser, so we use the React DOM package to convert this UI into DOM
nodes that the browser can understand.

This separation between React elements and DOM elements is part of what makes
your React knowledge (or even code) portable to environments other than the
browser.

## JSX

Using the `createElement` API directly is not very ergonomic, so when React was
initially announced it came with a special lightweight syntax addition to
JavaScript to make it easier to create elements. With that syntax, you can
create that same button like this

```tsx
const element = (
	<button onClick={() => console.log('clicked!')}>Click me!</button>
)
```

Because this is a syntax addition that browsers don’t natively run, you need to
compile your code before the browser can interpret it. You can technically do
this right in the browser (I built an app I used daily for years that did things
this way actually), but it’s not optimal.

In most apps, you’ll be using a tool to convert your JavaScript anyway. You’ll
at least want a minifier to reduce the amount of text you send over the network
and likely a bundler to reduce the number of files the browser has to load. On
top of this, especially in anything serious, you’ll want to use TypeScript which
supports JSX natively.

Writing UI in this way is delightful. It takes most developers just a few hours
of study and practice to understand how JSX translates to regular JavaScript,
then you can be highly effective working in the syntax because it’s basically
just JavaScript anyway.

## Reusable elements: Components

As React is written in JavaScript, you can of course create parameterized
functions which return React elements. React has formalized this in something
called a component and it’s how you can create custom React elements. To top it
off, you can parameterize these components using something called “props” which
is an object received by your component:

```tsx
function ClickMeButton(props) {
	return <button onClick={props.onClick}>Click me!</button>
}
```

You can then create that element like other elements:

```tsx
const element = <ClickMeButton onClick={() => console.log('clicked!')} />
```

Here’s what that element object looks like:

```tsx
{
  "$$typeof": Symbol(react.element),
  "type": ClickMeButton,
  "key": null,
  "ref": null,
  "props": {
    "onClick": () => console.log('clicked!')
  },
  "_owner": null,
  "_store": {}
}
```

When React is ready to render this UI, it will call your function with the props
to retrieve the other elements it needs to render.

This API enables React components to compose together in beautifully powerful
ways that a decade later we’re still benefitting from. It enables us to build
highly reusable abstractions. For example, you could package up all the
accessibility requirements for a tabs UI in a couple components that work
together and offer something like this:

```tsx
<Tabs defaultValue="account">
	<TabsList>
		<TabsTrigger value="account">Account</TabsTrigger>
		<TabsTrigger value="password">Password</TabsTrigger>
	</TabsList>
	<TabsContent value="account">Make changes to your account here.</TabsContent>
	<TabsContent value="password">Change your password here.</TabsContent>
</Tabs>
```

Composition is the name of the game when it comes to React, even between
server-only code which generates the UI and client-side code which makes the UI
interactive. Speaking of making the UI interactive…

## Updating UIs with React

React not only helps you generate the initial UI, but also manage changes to
that UI over time. Whether you’re building an interactive experience for users,
or a dashboard that updates in the background, React will help you keep your UI
up-to-date.

Data is used to generate the UI. When that data can change over time, we call it
state. In React, you can manage this state a number of ways, but the primary
mechanism is via a function called `useState` . This function can only be used
within custom components so React knows what UI to update when the state
changes:

```tsx
function Counter() {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
	const increment = () => setCount((c) => c + 1)
	return <button onClick={increment}>Current Count: {count}</button>
}
```

Whenever the user clicks the button, `setCount` is called which notifies React
that the state value needs to be changed and React needs to retrieve the new
elements based on that new value.

As mentioned, there are several ways to manage state built-into React, but the
basic idea is always the same: an update happens, React calls the component
again with the updated value, React compares what you return this time with what
was returned last time and updates the DOM accordingly. In our case the
`textContent` of the `button` will be updated each time the button is clicked.

## So, what is React?

Like I said at the start, React is a JavaScript library for creating user
interfaces and managing user interactions. There are of course more things to
talk about when it comes to building web applications with the most widely used
tool in the business with the biggest ecosystem, but this is as far as we’ll
take it today.

I’m going to be publishing a lot of articles diving deeper in these aspects and
others (so sign up to be notified when they become available!).

React has evolved over the last more than decade since its original release, but
the core concept of composability has remained and been pushed further and
further over the years. I’ve never been more excited about building applications
with React and it just keeps getting better. Thanks for joining me for the ride!
