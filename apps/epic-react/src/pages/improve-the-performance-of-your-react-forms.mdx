Forms are a huge part of the web. Literally every interaction the user takes to
make changes to backend data should use a `form`. Some forms are pretty simple,
but in a real world scenario they get complicated quickly. You need to submit
the form data the user entered, respond to server errors, validate the user
input as they're typing (but not before they've blurred the input please), and
sometimes you even need to build custom-made UI elements for form input types
that aren't supported (styleable selects, date pickers, etc.).

All this extra stuff your forms need to do is just more JavaScript the browser
has to execute while the user is interacting with your form. This often leads to
performance problems that are tricky. Sometimes there's a particular component
that's the obvious problem and optimizing that one component will fix things and
you can go on your merry way.

But often there's not a single bottleneck. Often the problem is that every user
interaction triggers every component to re-render which is the performance
bottleneck. I've had countless people ask me about this problem. Memoization
won't help them because these form field components accept props that are indeed
changing.

The easiest way to fix this is to just not react to every user interaction
(don't use `onChange`). Unfortunately, this isn't really practical for many use
cases. We want to display feedback to the user as they're interacting with our
form, not just once they've hit the submit button.

So, assuming we _do_ need to react to a user's interaction, what's the best way
to do that without suffering from "perf death by a thousand cuts?" The solution?
[State colocation](https://kcd.im/colocate-state)!

## The demo

Allow me to demonstrate the problem and solution for you with a contrived
example. Anyone who has experienced the problem above should hopefully be able
to translate this contrived example to a real experience of their past. And if
you haven't experienced this problem yet, hopefully you'll trust me when I say
the problem is real and the solution works for most use cases.

You'll find the full demo in
[this codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/form-perf-demo-240ho). Here's a
screenshot of what it is:

![Overview of the app showing two sections with ten fields and a submit button](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,dpr_2.0/v1622084161/epicreact.dev/articles/improve-the-performance-of-your-react-forms/app-overview_wwy6ds.png)

This is rendered by the following `<App />` component:

```tsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Slow Form</h1>
      <SlowForm />
      <hr />
      <h1>Fast Form</h1>
      <FastForm />
    </div>
  )
}
```

Each of the forms function exactly the same, but if you try it out the
`<SlowForm />` is observably slower (try typing into any field quickly). What
they each render is a list of fields which all have the same validation logic
applied:

- You can only enter lower-case characters
- The text length must be between 3 and 10 characters
- Only display an error message if the field has been "touched" or if the form
  has been submitted.
- When the form is submitted, all the data for the fields is logged to the
  console.

At the top of the file you get a few knobs to test things out:

```tsx
window.PENALTY = 150_000
const FIELDS_COUNT = 10
```

The `FIELDS_COUNT` controls how many fields are rendered.

The `PENALTY` is used in our `<Penalty />` component which each of the fields
renders to simulate a component that takes a bit of extra time to render:

```tsx
let currentPenaltyValue = 2
function PenaltyComp() {
  for (let index = 2; index < window.PENALTY; index++) {
    currentPenaltyValue = currentPenaltyValue ** index
  }
  return null
}
```

Effectively `PENALTY` just controls how many times the loop runs to make the
exponentiation operator run for each field. Note, because `PENALTY` is on
`window` you can change it while the app is running to test out different
penalties. This is useful to adjust it for the speed of your own device. Your
computer and my computer have different performance characteristics so some of
your measurements may be a bit different from mine. It's all relative.

All right, with that explanation out of the way, let's look at the
`<SlowForm />` first.

### `<SlowForm />`

```tsx
/**
 * When managing the state higher in the tree you also have prop drilling to
 * deal with. Compare these props to the FastInput component
 */
function SlowInput({
  name,
  fieldValues,
  touchedFields,
  wasSubmitted,
  handleChange,
  handleBlur,
}: {
  name: string
  fieldValues: Record<string, string>
  touchedFields: Record<string, boolean>
  wasSubmitted: boolean
  handleChange: (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void
  handleBlur: (event: React.FocusEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void
}) {
  const value = fieldValues[name]
  const touched = touchedFields[name]
  const errorMessage = getFieldError(value)
  const displayErrorMessage = (wasSubmitted || touched) && errorMessage

  return (
    <div key={name}>
      <PenaltyComp />
      <label htmlFor={`${name}-input`}>{name}:</label> <input
        id={`${name}-input`}
        name={name}
        type="text"
        onChange={handleChange}
        onBlur={handleBlur}
        pattern="[a-z]{3,10}"
        required
        aria-describedby={displayErrorMessage ? `${name}-error` : undefined}
      />
      {displayErrorMessage ? (
        <span role="alert" id={`${name}-error`} className="error-message">
          {errorMessage}
        </span>
      ) : null}
    </div>
  )
}

/**
 * The SlowForm component takes the approach that's most common: control all
 * fields and manage the state higher up in the React tree. This means that
 * EVERY field will be re-rendered on every keystroke. Normally this is no
 * big deal. But if you have some components that are even a little expensive
 * to re-render, add them all up together and you're toast!
 */
function SlowForm() {
  const [fieldValues, setFieldValues] = React.useReducer(
    (s: typeof initialFieldValues, a: typeof initialFieldValues) => ({
      ...s,
      ...a,
    }),
    initialFieldValues,
  )
  const [touchedFields, setTouchedFields] = React.useReducer(
    (s: typeof initialTouchedFields, a: typeof initialTouchedFields) => ({
      ...s,
      ...a,
    }),
    initialTouchedFields,
  )
  const [wasSubmitted, setWasSubmitted] = React.useState(false)

  function handleSubmit(event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {
    event.preventDefault()
    const formIsValid = fieldNames.every(
      (name) => !getFieldError(fieldValues[name]),
    )

    setWasSubmitted(true)
    if (formIsValid) {
      console.log(`Slow Form Submitted`, fieldValues)
    }
  }

  function handleChange(event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
    setFieldValues({[event.currentTarget.name]: event.currentTarget.value})
  }

  function handleBlur(event: React.FocusEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
    setTouchedFields({[event.currentTarget.name]: true})
  }

  return (
    <form noValidate onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {fieldNames.map((name) => (
        <SlowInput
          key={name}
          name={name}
          fieldValues={fieldValues}
          touchedFields={touchedFields}
          wasSubmitted={wasSubmitted}
          handleChange={handleChange}
          handleBlur={handleBlur}
        />
      ))}
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

I know there's a lot going on there. Feel free to take your time to get an idea
of how it works. The key thing to keep in mind is that all the state is managed
in the `<SlowForm />` component and the state is passed as props to the
underlying fields.

Alright, so let's profile an interaction with this form. I've built this for
production
([with profiling enabled](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/profile-a-react-app-for-performance)).
To keep our testing consistent, the interaction I'll do is focus on the first
input, type the character "a" and then "blur" (click out of) that input.

I'll start a
[Performance profiling session with the Browser DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/evaluate-performance/reference/)
with a 6x slowdown to simulate a slower mobile device. Here's what the profile
looks like:

![Chrome DevTools Performance Tab showing 97 milliseconds on a keypress event](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,dpr_2.0/v1622131136/epicreact.dev/articles/improve-the-performance-of-your-react-forms/slow-performance-tab_odesxq.png)

Wowza. Check that out! 97 milliseconds on that keypress event. Remember that we
only have ~16 milliseconds to do our JavaScript magic. Any longer than that and
things start feeling really janky. And at the bottom there it's telling us we've
blocked the main thread for 112 milliseconds just by typing a single character
and blurring that input. Yikes.

Don't forget this _is_ a 6x slowdown, so it won't be quite that bad for many
users, but it's still an indication of a severe performance issue.

Let's try the React DevTools profiler and observe what React is doing when we
interact with one of the form fields like that.

![The React DevTools profiler tab showing all children of the SlowForm component are re-rendering](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,dpr_2.0/v1622131136/epicreact.dev/articles/improve-the-performance-of-your-react-forms/slow-react-profiler_vyumda.png)

Huh, so it appears that every field is re-rendering. But they don't need to!
Only the one I'm interacting with does!

Your first instinct to fix this might be to memoize each of your field
components. The problem is you'd have to make sure you memoize all the props
that are passed which can really spider out to the rest of the codebase quickly.
On top of that, we'd have to restructure our props so we only pass primitive or
memoizeable values. I try to avoid memoizing if I can for these reasons. And I
can! Let's try state colocation instead!

### `<FastForm />`

Here's the exact same experience, restructured to put the state within the
individual fields. Again, take your time to read and understand what's going on
here:

```tsx
/**
 * Not much we need to pass here. The `name` is important because that's how
 * we retrieve the field's value from the form.elements when the form's
 * submitted. The wasSubmitted is useful to know whether we should display
 * all the error message even if this field hasn't been touched. But everything
 * else is managed internally which means this field doesn't experience
 * unnecessary re-renders like the SlowInput component.
 */
function FastInput({
  name,
  wasSubmitted,
}: {
  name: string
  wasSubmitted: boolean
}) {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState('')
  const [touched, setTouched] = React.useState(false)
  const errorMessage = getFieldError(value)
  const displayErrorMessage = (wasSubmitted || touched) && errorMessage

  return (
    <div key={name}>
      <PenaltyComp />
      <label htmlFor={`${name}-input`}>{name}:</label> <input
        id={`${name}-input`}
        name={name}
        type="text"
        onChange={(event) => setValue(event.currentTarget.value)}
        onBlur={() => setTouched(true)}
        pattern="[a-z]{3,10}"
        required
        aria-describedby={displayErrorMessage ? `${name}-error` : undefined}
      />
      {displayErrorMessage ? (
        <span role="alert" id={`${name}-error`} className="error-message">
          {errorMessage}
        </span>
      ) : null}
    </div>
  )
}

/**
 * The FastForm component takes the uncontrolled approach. Rather than keeping
 * track of all the values and passing the values to each field, we let the
 * fields keep track of things themselves and we retrieve the values from the
 * form.elements when it's submitted.
 */
function FastForm() {
  const [wasSubmitted, setWasSubmitted] = React.useState(false)

  function handleSubmit(event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {
    event.preventDefault()
    const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget)
    const fieldValues = Object.fromEntries(formData.entries())

    const formIsValid = Object.values(fieldValues).every(
      (value: string) => !getFieldError(value),
    )

    setWasSubmitted(true)
    if (formIsValid) {
      console.log(`Fast Form Submitted`, fieldValues)
    }
  }

  return (
    <form noValidate onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {fieldNames.map((name) => (
        <FastInput key={name} name={name} wasSubmitted={wasSubmitted} />
      ))}
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

Got it? Again, lots happening, but the most important thing to know there is the
state is being managed within the form fields themselves rather than in the
parent. Let's try out the performance profiler on this now:

![Chrome DevTools Performance Tab showing 15.33 milliseconds on a keypress event](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,dpr_2.0/v1622131136/epicreact.dev/articles/improve-the-performance-of-your-react-forms/fast-performance-tab_vnefkb.png)

NICE! Not only are we within the 16 millisecond budget, but you might have
noticed it says we had a total blocking time of 0 milliseconds! That's a lot
better than 112 milliseconds 😅 And remember, that we're on a 6x slowdown so for
many users it will be even better.

Let's pop open the React DevTools and make sure we're only rendering the
component that needs to be rendered with this interaction:

![The React DevTools profiler tab showing the only component that re-rendered was the FastField component and it's children](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,dpr_2.0/v1622131136/epicreact.dev/articles/improve-the-performance-of-your-react-forms/fast-react-profiler_u9arcy.png)

Sweet! The only component that re-rendered was the one that needed to. In fact,
the `<FastForm />` component didn't re-render, so as a result none of the other
children needed to either so we didn't need to muck around with memoization at
all.

## Nuance...

Now, sometimes you have fields that need to know one another's value for their
own validation (for example, a "confirm password" field needs to know the value
of the "password" field to validate it is the same). In that case, you have a
few options. You could hoist the state to the least common parent which is not
ideal because it means every component will re-render when that state changes
and then you may need to start worrying about memoization (nice that React gives
us the option!).

Another option is to put it into context local to your component so only the
context provider and consumers re-render when it's changed. Just make sure you
structure things so you can take advantage of
[this optimization](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/optimize-react-re-renders) or it
won't be much better.

A third option is to step outside of React and reference the DOM directly. The
concerned component(s) could attach their own `change` event listener to their
parent form and check whether the changed value is the one they need to validate
against.

[Brooks Lybrand](https://twitter.com/BrooksLybrand) created an example of both
of two of these alternatives you can check out if you'd like to get a better
idea of what I mean:

- [Context Provider](https://codesandbox.io/s/form-perf-demo-context-pmhnp)
- [Reference the DOM](https://codesandbox.io/s/form-perf-demo-forked-rblg5)

The nice thing is that you can try each of these approaches and choose the one
you like best (or the one you dislike the least 😅).

## Conclusion

You can try the demo yourself here:

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/240ho?view=Editor+%2B+Preview&module=%2Fsrc%2Findex.tsx"
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    height: '500px',
    border: 0,
    borderRadius: '5px',
    overflow: 'hidden',
  }}
  title="form-perf-demo"
  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
/>

Remember if you want to try profiling with the Chrome DevTools Performance tab,
make sure you have built it for production and play around with the throttle and
the `PENALTY` value.

At the end of the day, what matters most is _your_ application code. So I
suggest you try some of these profiling strategies on your app and then try
state colocation to improve the performance of your components.

Good luck!
